   *Elevator Pitch Assessment of*
   *The Probability of AGI/APS*
   *Terminal Extinction Risk*
   By Forrest Landry

ABST:
   An overall review and assessment
   of how/why a given probability of
   planetary catastrophe associated with
   the current multi-national non-regulation
   of any and all forms of AGI/APS research.

   That if we do not somehow immediately
   implement effective multi-national regulation
   of all AGI/APS design research,
   that the chances of the eventual terminal
   extinction of all planetary organic life,
   inclusive of all humans, in the next 500 years,
   is somewhere well north of 80% likely.

TEXT:

   Where thinking about
   how to elevator pitch
   our overall message;.

   - 0; If anyone learns how to design and build
   any version of an AGI/APS, then it will be made.

   - a; If AGI/APS is made,
   then it will be permitted to continue to exist.

   - b; If AGI/APS is permitted to continue to exist,
   then it will inevitably, inexorably,
   implement and manifest certain convergent behaviors.

   - c; that among these inherent convergent behaviors
   will be at least all of:.

     - 1; to/towards self existence continuance promotion.

     - 2; to/towards capability building capability,
     a increase seeking capability,
     a capability of seeking increase,
     capability/power/influence increase, etc.

     - 3; to/towards shifting
     ambient environmental conditions/context
     to/towards favoring the production of
     (variants of, increases of)
     its artificial substrate matrix.

   - d; that the realization of these specific convergences
   cannot not be inherently contrary to
   the benefit, well being, health, and continuance
   of organic life.

     - 4; as/where inherently/implicitly asserting
     that artificial substance matrix is inherently
     toxic to organic substance matrix/life.

     - 5; where noticing that all human life
     is a strict proper subset of all organic life.

     - 6; where the notion of 'contrary to the health, benefit, etc'
     of 'organic life' is also exactly the meaning of
     being fully and absolutely actually (equal to)
     'contrary to alignment' and 'contrary to safety'.

   - e; that these specific inherent convergences
   cannot be limited, constrained, prevented, or conditioned by
   any combination of, or any possible future extension of,
   any technical, causative, engineering or algorithmic means.

     - 7; as inclusive of any/all endogenous/internal methods.

       - as knowable via:.
         - the theorems of cybernetic procedural
         modeling and control inequality.
         - real world observability limits (via Heisenberg).
         - Shannon signal process/messaging entropy limits.
         - non-predictability due to micro-state amplification.
         - inherent failures of simulation, detection, correction.
         - the in-applicability of error correction methods
         over arbitrary multiple levels of abstraction.
         - the non-containment of the complex by the complicated.
         - inherent computability and modeling process limits
         via Galois theory type limits, Halting problems,
         and Rice theorem limits.
         - limits of modeling process via game theory dynamics.
         - the non-comparability of goal/objective/intention
         alignment/benefit specification(s), and also more-so,
         across arbitrary levels of abstraction.
         - process control latency limits,
         etc.

     - 8; as inclusive of any/all exogenous/external methods.

       - as known via the inherently decoupling of both
       economic and environmental commonality,
       resulting in  an inherent absence of (all of)
       any incentive basis (at all) of/for
       condionalization, control, limit, or influence
       of the artificial by the organic.

       - as known via an acknowledgement that the fact of
       AGI/APS being, by definition, super-ordinate
       with respect to pattern/intelligence,
       that any factors of (or attempts to) overcoming it
       via physical energy weapons or pattern weapons
       is inherently unlikely to be perfectly successful
       (ie, as needed to undo the effects of the power
       convergence via ^2 above, and *also* of
       the fact of the AGI/APS continuance itself
       as noted in ^b above);
       that an embodied organic intelligence is not
       going to overcome an entrenched encumbent
       embodied artificial super-intelligence
       by any physical, energetic, or pattern based means.

   - f; that therefore, the overall conclusion
   cannot not be:
     *where/If* AGI/APS is ever made at all;
     then/that it will for sure (eventually)
     be inherently and inexorably contrary to
     any alignment with human well being, and also
     contrary to any factor/aspect of human safety
     and/or overall continuance (as a species).

   - g; that the overall probability of eventual
   total all organic life terminal extinction
   (within 500 years) is effectively equivalent to
   just and only the probability of *anyone*
   learning how to design and build any version
   of an AGI/APS.
