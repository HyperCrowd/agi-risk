   TITL:
      <b>Rejecting the News</b>
      By Forrest Landry
      December 1st, 2022.
   </p>
   <p>
   ABST:
      Some sharp remarks about how the various tech
      communities are involved in various kinds of
      mixed messages and deceptively inconsistent
      applications of their own argumentative forms.
   </p>
   <p>
   TEXT:

   <p>
      A wonderful observation of typical mass media
      false claim form from (@ Astral Codex Ten https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/if-the-media-reported-on-other-things?utm_source=%2Finbox&utm_medium=reader2):.
   </p>
   <p>

   </p>
   <p>
      That the transition of 'can do X' and therefore
      "we expect you/technology to be able to do 'Q'"
      is so common as to be endemic.  People in the
      tech community (EA/LW/AF/HN and living in SF and/or
      in Silicon Valley in general) believe that
      "technology is neutral" and "technology can solve
      all problems" (and replace all things, life, etc).
   </p>
   <p>
      Hence, anyone doing any limited single thing
      with or by using technology "should" also be able
      to do _anything_at_all_ with technology.
   </p>
   <p>
      So then we do actually see Alignment Forum people
      saying/describing exactly the same logic as
        "we should, in principle, do anything we want to,
        given enough effort, money/resources, etc" --
      therefore,
        "you too should donate to our 'effective cause',
        'Make AGI Safe' which is tax deductible,
        and will make you and your org
        look good, smart and capable!".
   </p>
   <p>
      It is either false belief in an impossible task,
      to be solved by 'rationality tech' and/or AGI itself.
        (ie, by assuming what is wanting to be proved --
        that we "can make a safe AGI" if we already have
        a save AGI (but _only_ if we _also_ assume
        that all AGI also has God-like powers too)).
   </p>
   <p>
      And so of course there is a crypto FTX fund to
      setup a prize to make AGI either look good for
      making 'many great changes in the world economy'
      and/or to <b>maybe</b> also show/certify
        "that AGI risk is actually overblown/overrated"
      and
        'people are making a mountain out of a molehill'.
   </p>
   <p>
      Ie, it is not just the media making false arguments
      in regards to over-generalizing and domain switching.
      This <b>same</b> sort of equivocation is <b>also</b> being made
      by the 'rationalist' people themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
   :aks
      But then we notice more from (@ this post https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/if-the-media-reported-on-other-things?utm_source=%2Finbox&utm_medium=reader2):.
   </p>
   <p>
      > Recently, bright young people have been energized by
      > 'the political activist movement'.
   </p>
   <p>
      > 'Political activism' is a theory that says "instead of
      > helping your friends or spending time with your family,
      > that you should have opinions on national politics,
      > vote for candidates you like, donate to campaigns,
      > and go to protests".
   </p>
   <p>
      These high-sounding ideas are actually a cover for
      the same old 'command and control', 'divide and conquer'
      and 'colonialist' means by which people are divided
      against one another and hidden interests continue to
      ensure that inequality continues to increase favoring
      the rich/powerful getting richer and more power.
   </p>
   <p>
      Of course the recommendations are _<b>not</b>_ give your
      valuable time, attention, and and resources to your
      friends and family and local community --
      you "should" instead give them to "the system", to us,
      so that we can profit at your expense and moreover,
      gain power over you via your tacit 'authorization'
      of our "representing your interests" (though actually
      our own interests) via your "vote".  Of course you
      are on the car salesman lot and you are NOT allowed
      to leave: you can buy the blue vehicle or the red one,
      but for sure, we will take your money and force you
      to take our patented control designs into your lives!).
   </p>
   <p>
      Your 'opinions' on "national politics" are of no consequence
      to anyone.  The "national politics" are a distraction theater
      from the real issues, setup via our tacit influence over
      the commercialism of the mass media, which will not want
      you to know about the mass pollution and mass inequality
      created by our paid corporate lobbyist favoring policies.
      Any time you spend going to or doing protests is a nice
      distraction from focus on real issues or real methods of
      effecting change in our halls of power.  Oh, and thank you
      for your donations to our campaigns -- our carefully
      selected "support the system" candidates will for sure
      not include anyone that will represent real change,
      though we will for sure continue to fester your "hope"
      that "maybe this time it will be different".

   </p>
   <p>
      Of course, this includes giving money to false charity
      fronts that simply have gotten ever more effective at
      marketing themselves to be seeming to be "effective"
      in whatever they have selected/chosen to be their
      selected 'charity causes', and of course, they will not
      consult the people they are pretending to serve about
      the actual effects of their forced upon them "solutions",
      nor will they consult with and include the "normals"
      who do not have values 'in alignment' with their chosen
      "rationalist methods" and long utilitarian machine values.
   </p>
   <p>
      In fact, only technology, money, and resources are valued,
      so humanity and life can simply maybe get "uploaded" at
      some future point into eternal 'techno utopian happiness'.
        (We get to charge you rent for server space and sell you
        virtual entertainment (things with artificial scarcity
        and zero marginal production costs -- all profit, all
        the time -- except that simulated you will be replaced
        with simulated numbers -- you and your future families
        will never be given any choice about anything, at all, ever).
   </p>
   <p>
      In the interim, we will gamify everything and setup crypto
      schemes so that our technology and phone apps and VR systems
      will continue to take away your time, focus, and attention
      to our benefit (never mind any ambient harms to your
      relationships with friends and loved ones, or focus on
      ever doing or working on your own community projects, etc).

   :5sy
      And then, in other news, we maybe came across this article:.
   </p>
   <p>
      > The X non-profit org is in trouble, with their executive
      > team accused of simply working only to their own benefit.
      > Everyone in their org has diverted a lot of the resources
      > to servicing their own private mega-mansion and lobbyists,
      > while not actually forwarding more than the minimum possible
      > amount to/towards the 'X' org cause.  Moreover, most of the
      > the charitable contributions to 'X' org come from a very

      > their lack of ethics in their own money acquisition methods.
      > Something like this is bound to happen in any institution.
   </p>
   <p>
      > Anyone who truly believed the effective 'X' org marketing
      > "horrible things will happen to your families children"
      > (unless you give our non-profit org lots of money to
      > stop that) would also be maybe susceptible to extortion.
      > Such people would feel licensed to take any action,
      > no matter how antisocial, to prevent this calamity.
      > Hence, the 'X' org has gained in power and influence.
   </p>
   <p>
      > Of course, the executives of the 'X' non-profit org
      > do privately agree that this is actually very profitable
      > for them, though of course they do not want you to know,

      > as a kind of distraction from what is really going on --

      > that members should always be trustworthy and obey the law,
      > these statements are belied by their continued insistence
      > that your children will die unless you give them money.
      > They need to do better, though of course, in a followup
      > reply to this article, they did also suggest that maybe

      The we noticed this as maybe found in a blog somewhere:.

        Of course, maybe none of this is about Facebook or Zuckerberg.
        We could be talking about anyone at all, in any corporation.

      Never mind the fragmented families and communities,
      the dusty empty hopeless towns, dilapidated slums,
      currently everywhere in every nation of the world,
      ones which are almost full of near homeless people
      that cannot afford to use, or have, any of that
      "big company" tech, which which bundled and locked
      so as to only serve their corporate masters.
