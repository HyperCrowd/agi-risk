  On the Nature of Human Assembly
  </p>
  <p>
  What is the overall idea?
  </p>
  <p>
  When people gather together, a group naturally forms. In many
  cases, it is desirable to have these natural groups persist in 
  time and have their existence be sustainable over the long term. 
  However, given the highly dynamic nature of interpersonal 
  communications and the variety of life events, developing the 
  right infrastructure for long term group success is far from easy. 
  This essay presents a model and pattern for one such infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
  Introduction
  </p>
  <p>
  In any grouping of people, there needs to be some sort of
  organizational principle, even if it is very informal or 
  implicit, that allows each person, each member, to more 
  effectively coordinate their own individual actions with 
  respect to the intents of the group as a whole.  As groups 
  get larger, the need for an explicit internal structure 
  increases.  For very large groups this need for formal 
  complexity becomes significant. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Yet, despite the many examples of large governments, 
  institutions, industries, etc, that currently exist, 
  the organizational principles necessary for them to be 
  sustainable are far from obvious.  In may cases, it is 
  not even obvious that they are sustainable at all -- 
  sometimes even large bodies fail without a single 
  identifiable cause.  Attempting to found a new group 
  or institution on the basis of an existing one can 
  often result in transparently, unconsciously, and implicitly 
  inheriting the weaknesses of the existing system.  Without 
  an awareness of the principles of group formation, there can 
  be little hope of real group longevity in the face of 
  significant enviromental or situational changes. 
  </p>
  <p>
  However, rather than attempting to deal with the complexity 
  of large scale groups directly, it is considered that 
  sustainable group systems can be identified by 1) 
  resolving a minimal abstract set of organizational concepts 
  (one which would span the total space of all organizational 
  systems) and 2) using those concepts to define the minimum 
  possible structure necessary to create a sustainable group. 
  Once the basic principles of long term group stability 
  have been identified in their simplest 'ideal' form, the 
  way is opened for the practical application of these ideals 
  to real groups. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In effect, it is considered that if any group can be made 
  sustainable, that the dynamics of that group can be treated 
  as a 'cell' and composed into larger groups which will also 
  be sustainable (using the same techniques as that internal 
  to the prototypical cell group itself).  Therefore, the 
  issues associated with group scale can be factored out. 
  This allows the consideration of sustainability to be applied 
  to small groups (with minimum complexity) as if they are 
  representative of all groups.  Of primary interest then is 
  what sort of minimal organizational dynamics would enable 
  any small group to be sustainable.
  </p>
  <p>
  Coherency assumptions particular to small groups
  </p>
  <p>
  For the purposes of this essay, some assumptions have been made
  about the motivations of the individuals who choose to gather 
  themselves into an intentional group.  Particularly, it is 
  assumed that each member is motivated and enabled to achieve the 
  benefits of combining their efforts with others in as positive 
  and as natural a manner as possible.  By "enabled" it is meant 
  that each member is sufficiently knowledgeable about themselves 
  and each other to achieve the necessary alignment of personal 
  intent in group action.  This is particularly apparent in situations 
  where the group may be required to respond quickly and decisively 
  to external situations.  For example, the members of a local fire 
  department will need to trust one another and one another's real and 
  embodied skills to effectively respond to the rapidly changing 
  situation of a fire.  The strength of an emergency response group 
  a group is largely dependent on the health of the members and such 
  groups will particularly require strong interpersonal bonds and 
  mutual trust between all members.  Although not all groups may 
  need to be this obviously and rapidly responsive, the internal 
  general structure of a generic group must have the capacity 
  to support these capabilities (should need arise).  This need for 
  capability sets a requirement on what group organization principles 
  will ultimately be considered viable (more on this below). 
  </p>
  <p>
  Also, it is assumed that the activities of the group are intended 
  to be of mutual benefit to the membership, community, and larger 
  world (ie, a criterion of sustainability).  Achieving these conditions 
  is a precursor to group formation.  The means by which individuals 
  can attain the sufficient level of personal health is beyond the 
  scope of this essay.  However, insofar as the continued and 
  sustained health of each member is especially important to the 
  continuance and sustainability of the group itself, the ideas of 
  an organizational principle of a group must itself be considered 
  in terms of nurturing strength.  In particular, the best overall 
  effectiveness of the group will occur when the relationships between 
  members, and the feelings of each member about the group as a 
  whole, are each nurturing of strength.  The degree to which the 
  health and strength of the group is maintained is therefore also a 
  basis for considering the effectiveness of a potential group 
  organizational principle.  This can be thought of as also consistent 
  with a notion of ethics which asserts a connection of the means by 
  which something is achieved and the nature of the ends which are realized. 
  For small groups just starting out, the focus of activity and intent 
  for the group must therefore be on establishing and maintaining the 
  emotional, intellectual, and communicative health of each member and 
  of member interactions prior to the group having an overall externally 
  coherent action or intent as a whole.  Small groups are therefore 
  first defined in terms of inner growth before they can be self defined 
  in terms of outer action and intent.
  </p>
  <p>
  Structural archtypes for group orginization
  </p>
  <p>
  In considering the many and various organizational models and principles
  that have been previously used to coordinate all sorts of groups, 
  a categorical analysis of the primary forms and structures will identify 
  three basic and fundamental types of decision making process.  For the 
  purposes of this essay, these three primary forms of decision making will 
  be referred to as 'the democracy', 'the meritocracy', and 'the consensus'. 
  (Note: These categories are known to be conceptually orthogonal insofar 
  as other and more complex types of organization can be shown to be a 
  scalar or linear superposition of these three basic types). 
  </p>
  <p>
  The three notions of an organizing principle can be briefly described 
  (in a characteristically simplified form) as follows: 
  </p>
  <p>
        In a democracy, a range of possible options is reviewed, discussion 
        and persuasion (rhetoric) is followed by a vote, and the majority 
        decision applies to the whole. 
  </p>
  <p>
        In a meritocracy, some process (it does not matter which), is used 
        to select a focus of decision making (a single person or smaller 
        group), which then (perhaps after listening to the considered 
        council of others) will make a decision which is applied to the 
        whole.  It is assumed that the whole will always and implicitly 
        trust the part to make decisions 'correctly' (whatever that notion 
        is taken to mean for the whole group). 
  </p>
  <p>
        In consensus, all members sit in council together and discuss 
        potential decisions together until a complete and total agreement 
        is reached among all members (however long it takes) which then 
        becomes the decision of the group. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Of these three basic types of organizing principle, smaller groups will 
  generally be best organized using the method of consensus.  When first forming, 
  consensus methods are the inherent default starting point for any group 
  dynamic (at least insofar as each member is freely able to determine for 
  themselves if they actually belong to the group).  Consensus decision 
  making has significant advantages in regards to unity, integrity, and strength. 
  Consensus, as a method of making group decisions, contributes to good feelings, 
  clear intents, and insight on the part of each member.  In consensus, 
  each person has the freedom of complete contribution and may participate 
  fully in the total agreement.  It is important that each member has 
  good feelings about the resulting decisions and a willingness to 
  participate fully in the action of the whole, particularly since this 
  has the effect of increasing the depth and the overall effectiveness of 
  the group in any action actually performed.   The more whole and integral the group, 
  and the better that each member feels about the others, the the stronger 
  the group and the stronger and more generally beneficial the results. 
  The sustainability of the outcome is in proportion to the strength and 
  unity of the group.  Thus, to a first approximation, consensus 
  is seen to contribute directly to group effectiveness. 
  </p>
  <p>
  However, on deeper consideration it becomes apparent that each of 
  these three organizing principles has some real disadvantages, and 
  consensus is not excepted.  Consensus, although it usually achieves 
  very high quality decisions, also takes the most time to implement. 
  Consensus requires frequent, continued, and sustained interaction of 
  the whole group.  Not all members may be as constantly and fully 
  available for the necessary and ongoing interaction and communication 
  that necessary for consensus decision making.  Even in the best of 
  circumstances, it is often difficult to find and coordinate the 
  necessary long meeting times inherent in the consensus process. 
  Furthermore, in situations requiring immediate decisive action, 
  (such as within the context of unexpected events and/or emergency), 
  consensus is completely unable to mediate fast, vital, 
  and necessary choice.  As such, consensus, although it is very strong 
  in quality, is also the very weakest in the sense of being the least 
  powerful (in quantity) of the three decision making methods summarized 
  above.  While the group is microscopically coherent, it is in some cases 
  macroscopically ineffective. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In contrast to consensus, systems of meritocracy, such as those having 
  a single person or small unit of people in some sort of hierarchical structure, 
  are the most powerful.  Meritocratic organizations, particularly in a 
  fast changing environment, are the most able to deal with situations requiring 
  immediate and decisive action (for example, any situation involving emergency or 
  danger).  Such organizations are generally flexible and are usually 
  the most effective in implementing powerful action with the highest 
  levels of effectiveness, due to their coordinated quality and 
  their focused and singular purity of intent.  Both strength and 
  flexibility are necessary for a group as a whole for it to remain 
  sustainable. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Unfortunately, as is well known, meritocratic systems, no matter how well 
  intended, are also the most susceptible to unconstrained abuse (although 
  powerful, meritocratic systems are infrequently also strong).  For a 
  group to last in a changing environment (where the rate of change can 
  sometimes be high) some element of meritocratic or executive organization 
  is desirable and useful in any real group.  Yet, due to the potentiality 
  for abuse the meritocratic method of organization is the also the most 
  likely to develop seriously disabling aspects and painful effects 
  for the group members.  Any occurrence of the negative aspects in 
  a meritocratic organization can quickly diminish the overall effectiveness, 
  health, and sustainability of a group due to less than committed component 
  actions on the part of the members.  While the macroscopic aspects of 
  the group are maintained, the microscopic aspects suffer.  Over time, 
  these small scale instabilities can magnify into larger concerns that 
  destabilize the group (coup events or other cancerous instabilities). 
  </p>
  <p>
  In recognizing the marked disadvantages of the meritocracy, and as an 
  attempt at moderating the demands for time and communication required 
  by consensus, one might consider the method of democracy to be the best 
  overall alternative.  In a democratic system, everyone gets 1) a chance 
  to think about the issues, 2) the option to make their choice known 
  (as selected from a fixed and finite set of options), and 3) a chance 
  to convince others of the correctness of their viewpoints.  In this 
  system, less in person and in council time and communication are 
  required than that needed for consensus.  Democratic methods often 
  appear simpler to define (in the short term at least), and the decisions 
  made by the group are usually (seemingly) unambiguous (and therefore 
  simpler to implement).  There is additionally a feeling of security and 
  freedom to choose with ones heart when anonymity is used as part of the 
  voting process.  Also, the democratic system overall tends to be much 
  more resistant to overt abuse than a meritocracy.  Such a system, 
  furthermore, is well suited to groups that cannot often meet or 
  communicate directly, and which therefore must use some form of 
  messaging.  Any group communication based primarily on messaging would 
  be too cumbersome to use for consensus decision making, and too slow and 
  dis-empowering for everyone when used as part of a meritocratic system. 
  </p>
  <p>
  As such, the democratic system of organization seems initially to be a 
  better balance of consensus, which makes decisions well (i.e., good 
  quality of choice), and authority, which makes decisions fast (i.e., 
  good quantity of choice).  Unfortunately, the democratic method of 
  organization has significant flaws as well, particularly when applied 
  to groups having a more familiar or tribal character. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The process of voting requires that the issues be clear cut and 
  partitionable into a finite set of specific options which can be 
  voted on.  Unfortunately in life, most such issues are rarely so 
  clear cut.  Real issues of value are often associated with various 
  feelings, personal emotions, and subjective intuitions.  Further, 
  insofar as creative decision making is about opening new potentialities 
  and working with the unknown and unknowable, the attempt to reduce 
  a problem to a finite set of specific options is very problematic. 
  The reduction of a hard and subtle value problem into such a finite 
  specificity as required for a vote must be regarded as being nearly 
  antithetical to any possibility of success. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Moreover, the process of choosing which options will be in the 
  total set of available options to be voted on is an often neglected 
  form of power which is frequently, but invisibly, abused in itself. 
  The context of the choice to be made, and the context in which the 
  choice is made, are themselves rarely the object of a democratic 
  process (it is a problem of regress which can be diminished, but 
  never completely and finitely resolved).  This covert shifting of 
  context can be seen, for example, in the efforts of a used car 
  salesman to enact the reality of one's primary choice as being 
  between buying the red car or the blue one, whereas the real choice 
  is whether or not to buy a vehicle at all.  Often, it is only in 
  the action of shifting the context of choice that a real solution 
  can be found.  The practice of democracy encourages a form of covert 
  abuse in making it always necessary to choose from a finite set of 
  options, whereas in real life, the number of options available is 
  always infinite. 
  </p>
  <p>
  To make matters worse, the action of the vote itself does little 
  to create group cohesiveness, necessary to the long term sustainability 
  of the group.  Majority rule, particularly if that majority is very 
  slight (51%), is oppressive to the minority necessarily left remaining. 
  The action of voting encourages a polarization, a schism of opinion, 
  between two factions. Even though the schism incurred by the voting 
  process is very obvious, the democratic method does not provide a means 
  to heal that division; it is an unavoidable divisiveness created by the 
  method itself. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Meritocracy and consensus both tend to heal such schisms of opinion 
  either through insight (the creation of a third additional option) 
  or through negotiation. Divisiveness is an especially problematic 
  element of democratic process in that it diminishes the unity of feeling 
  in a group.  The larger and lasting benefit of group action is in 
  geometric (or stronger) proportion a total coherency of group consciousness 
  operating as one together.  Two members working together can be much 
  stronger than having both work alone, yet the democratic method nearly 
  always splits a group into at least two disagreeing fractions, those for 
  and those against. By encouraging a false simplicity, much clarity and 
  depth of action is lost (creativity, spirituality, and awareness are 
  best enabled by clarity). 
  </p>
  <p>
  Furthermore, the minority must always feel unhappy with the 'group' 
  decision, the outcome of the vote when they are forced to accept the 
  'will of the whole'.  Members losing the vote must necessarily override 
  their own feelings and opinions.  Democracy encourages a suppression of 
  feeling; an action for the 'right' to have a vote, a fleeting voice, 
  in the decision at all (a voice, moreover, that is often reduced to 
  insignificance and meaninglessness in even moderately large groups). 
  Choice (and significance) is inherent in consciousness, at all levels 
  of being.  It is not 'licensed' from the whole to the part, or even 
  from the part to the whole. To make choice seem to be a temporary and 
  possibly revocable 'right' (for which one must barter their 
  unconditional acceptance of the unconscious tyranny of the majority, as 
  the democratic system must make it seem), is to act in a manner contrary 
  to fundamental truths of life itself: the true ownership of one's own 
  choices, the significance and meaningfulness of all choosing, and the 
  cooperative process by which all choice IS made.  In its worst forms, 
  democracy becomes a process antithetical to the dynamics of life, having 
  more the nature of a cancer than of a living being working as a unity 
  (and there are yet deeper layers of symbolism in this, for those who 
  have the eyes to see it!).  To have an action or a process be contrary 
  to life is to go directly against the interests of the group itself. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Worse still, the dialog that precedes the vote is itself subtly 
  flawed and distorted.  In that a vote is an event, the timing of 
  which is always finite and near, it encourages the action of speaking 
  rather than of listening, expressing rather than accepting.  In fixing 
  the time of a vote, communication becomes rushed and is soon replaced 
  by lecture and campaign.  Busy activity replaces the reflective space 
  necessary for insight, creativity, and the more inward forms of 
  communication inherent in the process of attaining truly effective 
  decisions. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Also, in being only about expression, the dialog presented before 
  the vote (ideally) would consist of (or have the form of, or at 
  least appear to be) reasonable arguments which are impersonal, 
  objective, and based only on logic and facts.  Yet such dialog must 
  always have the implicit objective, form, and purpose of convincing 
  others to vote in the same manner as oneself.  In that such expression 
  must therefore hide one's own personal subjective values and natural 
  desires (which ultimately can have no logical or reasonable basis) 
  within arguments which are designed to appear to be based on 
  impersonal objectivity and reason, the ideal dialog before the vote 
  is inherently deceptive.  In this, artfully constructed fictions 
  replace actual fact; reactions to images, symbols, and flags are used 
  to replace feelings of inner truth with emotions of fear and pride. 
  The ideal of democracy becomes only an expression of rhetoric before 
  the vote, a means of manipulation which justified in the terms of the 
  end of having others vote (or act) in some limited manner.  Rhetoric 
  cannot be trusted, even and especially when it appears to be 
  trustworthy. In that a group is inherently based on mutual regard and 
  trust, a transparent, considered, and conscious communication is 
  necessary for effectiveness. 
  </p>
  <p>
  To use rhetoric to encourage others to replace their thoughts with 
  those of the speaker, is in effect, to treat them as a machine, to 
  inherently regard them less intelligent and significant than oneself. 
  In this, concerns about the outcome of the vote override all concerns 
  for the people participating.  As a result, everyone (including the 
  "winners") feel like they have lost something important, some element 
  of truth and honor has been neglected.  Inwardly everyone knows 
  intuitively that the means used (deception and control of the vote) 
  cannot ever be justified in the terms of the ends, no matter how well 
  intentioned ("for the good of all").  One cannot value people and their 
  lives (life) by attempting to treat them (and all of nature) in the 
  manner of an ignorant and discardable machine.  Insofar as the group 
  values sustainability and life, these intents values must also be 
  reflected as an aspect of its practice, its realization, and its identity. 
  </p>
  <p>
  As such, the practice of democracy, and the politics it implies, 
  is by its very nature very disabling to the sustainability of a 
  small group.   The methods of 
  democracy strongly discourage participants from ever considering 
  matters of personal feeling and intuition in a natural manner. 
  The process of campaign is an invasive intrusion into one's own 
  inner dynamics of creativity; an evolution which is very necessary 
  when choosing with an alignment with the inner nature of life.  While an 
  authoritarian meritocracy has features that lend themselves to an 
  easy and overt abuse, a democracy is not much better in that it 
  lends itself to a covert abuse. 
  Yet, as has been described, neither consensus nor merit, as 
  potential methods for organizing a group, are ideal either.  All 
  three methods when practiced by themselves are inherently flawed 
  when considered in terms of the requirements of sustainable 
  group process. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Therefore, it is necessary to develop some other, alternate method 
  for organizing a groups which somehow combine the good effects of the 
  values of consensus decision making with power and decisiveness of 
  meritocratic methods.  Ideally, the alternative must 
  not introduce the known disabling effects associated with democracy, 
  merit, or consensus.  What is needed is a method for combining into 
  a new hybrid the high quality aspects of consensus decision making 
  with the high quantity of decision available from a meritocracy, 
  without introducing new disadvantages and potentials for abuse 
  inherent in each of these other forms.  In answer to this, this 
  essay will therefore consider an alternate method of combination 
  these forms to create a hybrid small group organization principle.
  </p>
  <p>
  Group method hybredization; a proposal
  </p>
  <p>
  The basis of the hybridization is to have the decisions of whatever
  the group DOES be defined in the terms of an organization of what the 
  group IS.  In other words, the dynamics of the group can be considered 
  in terms of two aspects in relation to one another: internal group 
  process and external group interactions ("is" and "does", or intra-group 
  and inter-group, respectively).  In that the group internal process and 
  the group external process are in relation to one another, this 
  relation is also an identified category of group process (since the 
  meta-dynamics 'is' and 'does' must also be in relation to one another). 
  In effect, there needs to be a natural means for the group to transition 
  from being to doing and then again transition back from doing to being. 
  The organizational principle which applies to this transition dynamic 
  is as necessary to the overall model as the organizational principles 
  which are individually applied to the being and doing of the group. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The result of these considerations is to 
  identify and use different decision making aspects at and for different 
  parts of the overall group process.  As such, 
  the method of consensus is to be used for 
  all organizational and planning aspects of the group 
  (omniscient modal aspects), 
  merit     is to be used as the basis of operation during actual 
  group action (executing a plan; immanent modal aspects), 
  and democracy is to be used as a moderator on the transition 
  from meritocracy back to consensus (transcendent modal aspects). 
  </p>
  <p>
  This simple method of combination provides for the working group 
  to have the best advantages of each basic decision making process, 
  while having few to none of the disadvantages implied by each. 
  The basis of the necessary correspondences are identified by modeling 
  the group in terms of identity and interaction theory (as intra-group 
  and inter-group theory, respectively).  Each of these aspects will be 
  considered in its own paragraph below. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Intra-group 
  process is an isomorph of the subjective, and therefore needs to have 
  full coherency and (eventually clear) representation of the overall 
  deep feelings and future dreams of the group.  Consensus process is 
  the best choice (optimal) when assigned to group internal dynamics, 
  particularly insofar as coherency is much more important than rapidity 
  when defining and identifying the group identity (the long term structure 
  of the group).  The key of this assignment is to recognize that with 
  respect to all elements of the intra-group process, that consensus 
  is the ultimate founding basis and therefore trumps all other defined 
  internal structure.  Where a previously selected group internal 
  structure or formalization has been found to be disadvantageous to 
  the group, consensus process is the ultimate solvent that allows for 
  group restructuring without also implying the loss of group identity 
  and integrity. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Inter-group process is an isomorph of the relation between the 
  subjective and the objective, and represents/is the actual actions 
  of the group (the exercise of group choice) in, on, upon, or within 
  the larger world.  Such action is (cannot not be) considered as within 
  the 'here and how' and has a sense of immediacy, representing the real 
  actions and consequence of the group existence.  Insofar as the specifics 
  of that interaction need to be immediate and real-time responsive, the 
  optimal choice of organizational principle will be one of merit.  As 
  a confirming aspect, it is to be noted that the hierarchal flow down 
  model associated with merit based systems of governance are also an 
  isomorph of the process of adding specification detail when an abstract 
  choice process becomes a concrete one. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The details of this hybridization can be clarified by considering 
  ideal dynamics of the group in the terms of event planning. 
  Consensus decision making is used for all decisions regarding the 
  basic intentions of each group action and for the practical, pragmatic 
  considerations involving the group itself.  For example, decisions 
  about membership (either adding or removing), in that it affects 
  the being of the group, are made by consensus.  When everyone 
  agrees, and in open forum has been allowed to express their feelings, 
  doubts, ideas, and intuitions, the group (with this sharing) has 
  as a whole come to some deeper insight about the decision, then 
  in that mutual agreement, the decision is made.  It is essential 
  to the process of consensus that everyone feels good about the final 
  outcome, and that each participant feels willing and positive about 
  participating.  Within the process of external group action, it is 
  important that the statement of intent be something that everyone can wholeheartedly 
  support.  In this respect, all group statements of intent are to 
  be decided by consensus.  Finally, consensus decision making is used 
  to select one of their number, on the basis of their merit, to act 
  as a focus for the duration of a specific group action, or as a chair 
  for the next consensus meeting.  Collectively, the process of having group 
  choice and effort be made on the basis of total agreement reached by 
  all members is referred to as a consensus process of decision making. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Within the context of a specific action, as chosen via consensus in 
  the whole group, and as expressed in the group statement of intent, 
  the person who was chosen, by consensus, as a focus is temporarily 
  empowered to make the single executive decisions about the actual 
  event execution. (Note; Having group choice and 
  effort be made on the basis of temporary authority invested in a 
  focus person is referred to as an "executive" decision making process). 
  The focus person, perhaps choosing to listen to the counsel and advice 
  of others (when there is time), acts as a basis of a meritocracy. 
  The consensus selected focus person organizes the action and is the 
  primary decision making agency during the event itself. 
  In this respect, for the duration of the action, there is an organizing 
  basis that can be responsive to the (occasional) unexpected situation. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Also, the process of making consensus decision by itself is often 
  significantly enhanced when there is someone to act as a facilitator 
  of that consensus.  The role of this person is to ensure that 
  everyone gets a chance to speak their truth and to attempt to 
  summarize the various ideas that have been presented so far.  It is 
  the responsibility of the consensus facilitator to try to ensure 
  that the consensus process itself works by creating the orderly 
  context in which everyone can speak. 
  </p>
  <p>
  As occasionally will happen, however, in the event that consensus 
  is not being reached because of an emotional conflict between members, 
  or in the event that the decisions of a selected focus person have 
  "gone too far", the democratic process would be used to moderate or 
  suspend either of these other two other forms of decision making.  In 
  effect, the democratic process can, via an unplanned spontaneous 
  majority vote, 1) suspend and veto the decisions of a focus person, 
  even to the point of suspending a current action, and thus effect 
  an immediate transition back to a consensus method of making decisions, 
  or in the event of standing disagreement in consensus (no motion), 
  2) act to temporarily suspend the consensus process until the 
  situation has 'cooled down' a bit.  As such then, the democratic 
  process of majority vote, although it is not used to make any 
  group choices in itself, is used to moderate or suspend the effects 
  of the other two means used by the group to make decisions (consensus 
  decision making and executive decision making).  In this way, the 
  democratic process can act as a 'check' on both the meritocratic 
  process and the consensus process, to ensure the smooth operation of each. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In summary then, there are only three basic methods by which group 
  decisions are made.  Each of these methods can be used to make two 
  different kinds of decisions, one particular to its own modality, and 
  one to act as a check on (to moderate the effects of) each of the 
  other two methods of decision making.  Each decision making methodology 
  has two primary responsibilities, and all three methods together 
  account for all (six) basic aspects of group management.  This overall 
  arrangement can be restated more compactly and symmetrically as follows: 
  </p>
  <p>
        That Consensus process, which is based on the total and heartfelt 
        agreement of all members of the group, is used to make 
        1) all of the important decisions about the being, nature, 
        and intent of the group and its actions, and 2) selecting 
        single individuals to act as a coordinating and decision 
        making focus each particular action, and the group member 
        who will be responsible for facilitating the next consensus 
        decision making meeting of the group (note different people 
        may be chosen for each role). 
  </p>
  <p>
        That Executive process, which is based only on the merit and authority 
        of the selected focus person, is used to make decisions about 
        1) the implementation of a specific group external action, and 
        2) how to best enable the consensus decision making 
        process during a group meeting. 
  </p>
  <p>
        That Democratic process, which is based on a spontaneous majority 
        vote of those present in any gathering of the group, is used 
        to make only two kinds of decisions: 1) whether to immediately 
        suspend the currently pending executive process (i.e., to 
        indefinitely suspend the authority of the currently acting 
        focus person) and return directly to a consensus decision 
        making process, and/or 2) whether to immediately suspend the 
        currently pending consensus decision making process, with 
        respect to a particular stalled decision.  (Note; In effect, 
        the latter aspect is a transition to a type of executive 
        process, usually to select a focus person who will ensure 
        that the issue is taken up at some (other) future scheduled 
        meeting, or suspended by vote again, if the situation warrants. 
        It is important to let the stalled decision rest for the 
        remainder of the current meeting, so that other issues can be 
        discussed if needed). 
  </p>
  <p>
  Aside from its simplicity, this hybridization has numerous advantages 
  for a small group.  Consensus process is used to make all of 
  the important decisions which affect the group as a whole.  Consensus 
  decision making serves as the foundation for all group activities and 
  allows each of the group members to come to know one another more 
  deeply.  As such, consensus decision making allows the group as a whole 
  to come to one mind about an issue.  In sharing insights each person may 
  more easily come to feel good about the decisions that are made.  This 
  enables the group to be whole, and acting as a whole, to be strong, 
  and thus enabled to work in a healthy and sustainable manner.  Overall, 
  the consensus process 
  provides the group with the ability to make high quality decisions in 
  the places where high quality choices are most needed.  By allowing for 
  transition to executive process, the cumbersome aspects of consensus 
  decision making are avoided.  By allowing supercession by democratic 
  process, a stuck or blocked consensus process can be prevented from 
  halting or freezing the group, ensuring that the group as a whole will 
  remain responsive, effective, and at peace with itself. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Executive process allows for the group to have the necessary 
  structured organization, responsiveness, and flexibility needed 
  to cope with the vast number of details of rapidly changing conditions 
  associated with the external environment (and the unexpected dynamics of life). 
  Executive process also provides the context and facilitating basis for effective 
  consensus decision making within a group.  Overall, the executive 
  process provides the group with the ability to make rapid and numerous 
  decisions in the situations where immediacy and decisiveness is most 
  needed.  By allowing supercession by the democratic process, the 
  executive process can be prevented from becoming dominating, or misused, 
  ensuring that the group remains healthy. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Democratic process ensures that neither the consensus process nor 
  the executive process ever becomes disabling.  By ensuring that there 
  is always a method for checking or relieving problematic situations 
  (such as halted or overly contentious group meetings and possible abuses 
  of focus authority), these other two forms of decision making are made 
  more sure and secure and the problems of rhetoric and loss of essence 
  associated with democratic process are avoided. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Overall, by maintaining a good balance and mixture of these three 
  types of decision making processes, the membership of a group should 
  be able to integrate in a healthy manner with the strength and 
  flexibility necessary for high quality combined works.  The 
  particular disadvantages of each type of decision making process are 
  offset by a balanced transition to the advantages of each of the other 
  types.  In this way, the best of all possible groups can be realized.

  <p>
  Detailed Description of Small Group Method:
  </p>
  <p>
  Consensus process decision making is used for:.
  </p>
  <p>
        - 1; selecting/electing the individual who will act as the 
        facilitator and/or chair of the consensus process itself. 
        - 2; defining or redefining the membership, internal structure, 
        named intent, values, objectives, dreams and aspirations, etc, 
        of the group. 
        - 3; selecting/electing the individual who will act as a focus of 
        responsibility and authority for a specific group external range 
        of action. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Consensus methods are always used to define all decisions 
  in relation to the being of the group itself, the basis 
  of choice for its actions, and the focus of responsibility 
  and authority to implement those actions. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Consensus methods are never used for decisions specific to 
  implementing an external action of the group, nor are they used 
  for suspending or withdrawing authority/responsibility from a 
  previously selected focus.  Consensus process methods also 
  cannot be used to moderate the process of consensus itself. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Executive process (meritocratic) decision making is used for:. 
  </p>
  <p>
        - 1; the implementation of a specific group external action. 
  </p>
  <p>
        - 2; how to best enable the consensus decision making 
        process during a group meeting. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Executive process methods are always used to define all 
  decisions in relation to the action, the doing of the 
  group itself.  Executive process, as mediated by a consensus 
  selected focus person acting in accordance with consensus 
  process resolved intents, is used to implement selected group 
  activities externally and to facilitate the consensus process internally. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Executive process is never used to make any decision relating 
  to the being of the group. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Democratic process, which is based on a spontaneous majority 
  vote of those present in any majority gathering of the group, 
  is used to make only two kinds of decisions:. 
  </p>
  <p>
        - 1; whether to immediately suspend the currently pending 
        executive process (i.e., to indefinitely suspend the authority 
        of the currently acting focus person) and return directly to 
        a consensus decision making process; this has the effect of 
        transitioning the group from 'doing' back to 'being'. 
  </p>
  <p>
        - 2; whether to immediately suspend the currently pending 
        consensus decision making process, with respect to a particular 
        stalled decision, and elect a different consensus facilitator. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Democratic process is used as a check on both the consensus 
  process and the executive process of the group and is used 
  for no other purpose.  Voting decisions are of exactly two 
  kinds: 1) whether to have a vote, and 2) whether to dismiss 
  the currently selected focus person.  Both of these decisions 
  are yes/no (boolean).  Whenever a majority requests a vote, 
  a vote is held.  A vote can be requested by a gathered majority 
  of the group at any time.  A majority result on a vote can be 
  used to immediately revoke the executive process authority 
  of a previously selected focus person or consensus facilitator, 
  (allowing for a new consensus facilitator to be elected by 
  consensus, if needed).
  </p>
  <p>
  Notes on the group action/identity distinction
  </p>
  <p>
  Insofar as the method of sustainable small group formation
  described above is characterized on a being/doing distinction 
  (the identity of the group as contrasted with the action of 
  the group), it is important to be able to clarify which 
  group decisions (interaction events) are to be classified 
  as belonging to which category (intra-group or extra-group 
  interactions).  The clarity of this resolution is essential 
  as it defines which choices are within the scope of the 
  consensus decision making process and which decisions are 
  within the scope of the executive decision making process. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The basis for the distinction is found in the notion of 
  observability.  If the effects and consequences of a decision 
  are concretely visible to people who are not members of the 
  group, then the decision/choice is regarded as external and 
  part of the action of the group (extra-group interactions). 
  Otherwise, by default, all remaining decisions are considered 
  to be internal (intra-group interactions). 
  </p>
  <p>
  Implicit in this description is the assumption that all 
  group internal processes (the internal communications of 
  the group used to establish and consummate consensus process) 
  are maintained in a manner NOT visible to non-members.  The 
  reason for this apparent secrecy associated with consensus 
  process is associated with the need for the group identity 
  to be internally (rather than externally) defined.  External 
  agencies with visibility to the group internal process would 
  likely attempt to use this information to influence the 
  internal dynamics of the group.  Such influence would allow 
  non-members to functionally act as if possessing the privileges 
  of group membership, this weakening the significance of 
  membership, and thus the identity, of the group itself. 
  Insofar as the notion of membership is always, inherently, 
  and explicitly defined as isomorphic with the being of the 
  group, it is always an internal decision and should not 
  visible to group outsiders (even by indirection and inference). 
  As such, all communications associated with group consensus 
  process are considered to be private to the membership of 
  the group itself.
  </p>
  <p>
  Structural integration into larger group forms
  </p>
  <p>
  As outlined above, the hybrid dynamic of group organizational
  process using combined consensus, executive, and democratic 
  decision making methods is only directly applicable to small 
  groups.  The reason for this limitation is twofold. 1) Insofar 
  as consensus decision making implies and usually requires full 
  communication between all members of a group, and where the 
  number of inter-member messages rises geometrically in proportion 
  to the number of members, the communicative bandwidth required 
  of each member can quickly rise beyond the carrying capacity of 
  that individual.  2) Where executive process requires an explicitly 
  defined focus and range, the selection of that focus and its 
  degree of asymmetry must be commensurate with the grain size 
  of the group (ie, exactly one member).  Where the level of 
  focus asymmetry is too high, the demand stress on the selected 
  individual can exceed the available capabilities of that 
  person and/or require the formation of subgroup counsels; the 
  added complexity of which does not translate very efficiently 
  when considering the democratic process override on executive 
  process. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Given these constraints, the hybrid process can only validly 
  be applied directly to groups in the range of 6 to 30 members 
  (extreme limits) with groups of 10 to 16 members being 
  considered optimal.  However, larger organizations can be 
  composed of smaller ones by re-identifying the small group 
  itself as a member cell in a larger meta-group similarly 
  organized and constituted in aggregate as with each small 
  group.  This process can be continued for any number of 
  levels of scale so as to be able to form coherent 
  organizations of any number of individuals operating in 
  aggregate.  This composition method defines a specifically 
  bottom-up topology for larger groups (grassroots organizations). 
  </p>
  <p>
  Insofar as the interactions between groups in forming 
  a composition meta-group are effectively external to the 
  groups themselves, the action of intergroup communications 
  within the context of the meta-group need to be mediated via 
  executive process.  This has the implication that the 
  individual cell groups must be internally healthy enough 
  so as to select one of their internal members to act as a 
  liaison in communications with other groups on behalf of 
  the local membership.  This in effect constitutes a form 
  of local group representation, where the representative is 
  effectively immediately answerable to the represented cell 
  group by democratic override and consensus process. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Also, insofar as the communicative bandwidth limits identified 
  above will apply to the representative individual, it is 
  important that some composition constraints be observed: 
  </p>
  <p>
        - 1; The number of component cell groups in any meta-group 
        must not exceed the communicative capacity limits of a 
        representative individual, and therefore, each meta-level 
        can consist of at most 20 or so component groups.  It is 
        preferred that different focus representatives be elected 
        for each compositional level so as to not exceed the 
        capabilities of any specific group member (Note; this is 
        particularly relevant where meta-groups are themselves 
        combined into meta-meta-groups). 
  </p>
  <p>
        - 2; The membership decision of a cell group within a meta-group, 
        insofar as it is an aspect of the being/identity of both the 
        cell group and the meta-group, must be made by positive consensus 
        at both group levels.  The choice of the cell group to belong to 
        a meta-group, as determined by the cell group, is not the decision 
        of the elected representative, but is the result of an achieved 
        cell group consensus.  From the perspective of the meta-group, 
        the membership of the cell group is defined by the consensus 
        of all of the participating cell groups as mediated through 
        their elected representatives.  Only where both conditions hold 
        is cell membership in the meta-group established. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, it is noted that in the same manner that a single 
  individual can be a member of multiple groups (although this is 
  not necessary nor desirable), so also can specific cell groups 
  have membership in multiple meta-groups.  In this manner networks 
  of interchange can be created for arbitrarily complex structures. 
  This has the distinct advantage that while the specific structure 
  is everywhere clear, there is no concentration of organizational 
  complexity (or points of failure) at any particular locus within 
  the overall system.
