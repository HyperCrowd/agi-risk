     listing the levels of altruism scale.

  TEXT:
  </p>
  <p>
  - [20_20/06/12;12:35:03.02]:.
    - where define 'the levels of altruism':.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>level zero</b>:.
        - as completely unconscious.
          - as no self benefit action attempted.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>level half</b>:.
        - as ineffective for self benefit action.
        - as short term optimization
        and long term disadvantage.
        - example; {fact of / use of} the seven deadly sins.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>level one</b>:.
        - sublevel 1Z; as self action effective (only).
          - as game theory; psychopathy; "playing court".
  </p>
  <p>
        - sublevel 1A; as <b>maybe</b> able to provide for benefit
        to immediate kin (self copies made),
        or family unit, for reproduction need,
          (ie; elective where death is certain,
          and time to death is hard time bound,
          rather than purely risk bound).
  </p>
  <p>
        - sublevel 1B; can actually be able to enter into
        genuine collaboration (play behavior).
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>level 2 altruism</b>:.
        - as with respect to the tribal group.
          - where advantage; that a 'pure group of altruists'
          can defeat any other group
          in which there are some defectors
          (people operating to selfish interest).
        - where some groups continually win;
        as creating higher levels of honeypot value,
        which encourages members of the pure group
        to defect (thus become impure).
          - as a potential corruption of
          the purity of the group, in time.
          - as possible whenever there is
          capturable/fungible value.
            - as being able to move things
            from a commons value to a private value.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>level 3 altruism</b>:.
        - as with respect to the state.
           - example; national action;
           the non-tribal group.
        - as requiring the systems of law;
        compulsion of individual behavior,
        manipulation of signaling,
        politics compliance of person, etc.
        - that strong hierarchical controls
        can implement pseudo altruistic behavior
          (on the part of members of the species
          to nationalistic agendas).
        - that the use of these tools
        means that there is a loss of creative responsiveness,
        particularly to chronic problems,
        and moreover, issues of increased honeypot values.
          - as all will strongly strengthen parasitic activity,
          and loss of system creativity.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>level 4 altruism</b>:.
        - as with respect to the species.
        - as not yet achieved very widely
        outside of some religions.
          - example; as not yet attained; outside of
          Bodhisattva Enlightenment.
          - notice; that religion
          is on a pure donation basis.
            - as not actually an economic actor.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>level 5 altruism</b>:.
        - as with respect to the ecosystem
          (all species).
        - that no level examples are yet known.
  </p>
  <p>
      - <b>level 6 altruism</b>:.
        - as with respect to <b>all</b> alternate/other ecosystems,
        and inter-ecosystem relations.
          - as all possible life ecosystems.
        - as the level of altruism at which it is necessary
          (ie; as requiring)
        that a/any/the/all APS/AGI
        (systems/superintelligence)
        <b>must_be</b> coherent to.
          - where/if there was other
          tech advanced alien life
          elsewhere in the universe,
          that we <b>must</b> hope
          that they are <b>already</b>
          at this level of altruism,
          <b>before</b> any 1st contact senario.
  </p>
  <p>
          - where given the inherent risks;.
          - that any such alien civilization
          would be/become (make themselves) <b>very</b> sure
          that we also had comprehensively achieved
          this level of alturism <b>before</b> permitting us
          to notice that they exist at all
          (if at all possible).
  </p>
  <p>
    - that evolution most commonly favors
    the game theory of individuals
    of each species
    operating to their own benefit,
    and not having any altruistic aspect.
      - as seen by the species statistics.
      - that our own species predisposition
      to group level altruism
      is a built in,
      due to the unique nature of
      "what it means to be human".
  </p>
  <p>
      - as that the entropy of probabilities,
      and the dynamics of game theory,
      favors very strong emphasis on individual action,
      than any position in higher levels of altruism,
      on the scale of altruism.

  - [20_22/03/18;11:52:09.00]:.
    - where listing/defining
    the 'circles of concern' nomenclature:.
  </p>
  <p>
      - that the '<b>first circle of concern</b>'
      and/or 'a 1st circle' concern:.
        - as something that affects
        either self, family, or friends,
        or anyone that is in a direct 1st person
        personal relationship to the actor/agent.
  </p>
  <p>
      - that '<b>2nd circle of concern</b>':.
        - as anyone that is an acquaintance,
        or is someone that knows someone you care about.
          - as basically inclusive of the community.
  </p>
  <p>
      - that '<b>3rd circle of concern</b>':.
        - as effectively town, city, state,
        however that unit of institution is conceived of,
        and/or the total set of
        anyone you know or interact with,
        or might be expected to eventually interact with,
        in an institutional way.
  </p>
  <p>
      - that '<b>4th circle of concern</b>':.
        - as effectively all humans.
  </p>
  <p>
      - that '<b>5th circle of concern</b>':.
        - as effectively all of life.
  </p>
  <p>
      - that '<b>the 6th circle of concern</b>':.
        - as anything in the physical universe,
        the totality of universal ethics, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    - where considering peoples communicative acts:.
      - that 1st circle concerns dominate,
      at about 98% of all communication actions.
      - that the 2nd and 3rd circles of concern dominate
      the remainder.
      - that almost nothing of 4th and beyond
      even gets mentioning
      in anything beyond philosophical technicalities.
