ABST:
  - where answers to key questions
  as given/known from within the context
  of the Immanent Metaphysics.

TEXT:

  - where in another essay (@ "APS Details" https://mflb.com/ai_alignment_1/aps_detail_out.html);
  that three important questions were asked.
    - as questions which are considered primary relevant
    to understanding the actual degree of AGI x-risk.
  - that these questions are restated here,
  along with the relevant IM responses/answers,
  as given from within that context.

  - where it is acknowledged that the means and methods
  of assessment/response to these questions will likely/largely
  be unfamiliar to nearly all readers,
  and that therefore, there can be questions
  as to what actually is established thereby:.
    - that these responses are provided here
    more for the sake of completeness
    and for the actual absolute fullness of reasoning,
    insofar as the basis used for these assessments below,
    though it may not already be in itself obvious,
    are much more directly tied to
    the very foundations of epistemological process itself,
    and thus actually have a *very* much higher
    overall proof value
    than any other means would ever ultimately suggest.

    - that the methods and tools of evaluation and review
    that I might have available to me
    are generally unlikely to overlap and be common with
    the tools and methods of evaluation/insight/reason
    that others might have.
      - as that each person has their own heuristics
      and toolkit of intellectual reasoning methods,
      as a kind of language of insight
      native to themselves.
      - ie; as considering (@ "Presumptive Listening" https://mflb.com/ai_alignment_1/presumptive_listening_out.html).

    - that the fact of their being used
    majority unknown tools and methods
    does not in itself imply any failure
    to express active valid reasoning.
    - where the Axioms and the modalities
    are directly expressions of the very basis of:.
      - *ontology*, as about being/truth;..
      - *epistemology*, as knowing/proof; and;.
      - *axiology*, as the ultimate basis of value;.
    - ^; all of which are intrinsically required
    for any assessment of x-risk.
      - ie; ?; can we actually protect
      that which we all (at least implicitly)
      hold as most valued, most sacred, most relevant?.
    - than/that/therefore these methods/tools
    are simply structurally more relevant than
    most other methods of arguing about these ideas
    could ever even possibly be.

    - that sometimes, with some tools/methods,
    that the overall result is much easier to obtain --
    that some tools/methods, and/or domains of operation
    are simply more well suited to certain tasks than others.
      - that it is better to just use the right tool
      for the right kind of job.
      - that the simplicity of the application
      and/or the ease by which relevant connections are made,
      is not in itself an indicator
      of anything against of their actual validity.
      - that although the work be easier,
      that in itself is not an absense of 'showing the work',
      ie; of showing the reasoning involved.

    - that it is sometimes incumbent on the reader/reviewer
    to come to know and understand the tools themselves,
    especially if they are new,
    especially if they are relevant/useful
    in important and/or otherwise unexpected
    key, critical, and essential ways.

      - that it is only *sometimes* partially possible,
      for the convenience of the reader/reviewer,
      that their existing native tools/methods/understandings
      can be used/adapted to the proof purposes
      that are actually needed
      so as to construct an 'also valid parallel path'
      from what is currently known/believed
      to what is currently unknown, yet essential,
      and not *yet* believed to be the case.
      - that such adaptations and alternate forms
      of establishing the validity/proof
      of the same truth outcomes
      will be attempted, when and as possible,
      whenever possible.
        - as expressive of the needs/ethics
        of the situation itself; ie; mitigating x-risk.

    - where regardless of the proof method,
    the same outcome/result should be obtained.
      - as to have an absence of contradiction.
    - where herein as stated;
    that each of these three questions
    are structurally strictly isomorphs of one another.
      - that each of the different phrasings
      gives access to different ways
      of being able to know/prove the response.
    - that therefore the outcome answer (yes/no)
    to any one of them *should* be the same
    as for any of the others.
      - that each of the different ways of arriving
      at the same outcome therefore strongly *reinforces*
      the degree to which the actual outcome/answer
      can be epistemically trusted to be correct.
      - as inherently providing multiple distinct
      overlapping means/methods of establishing a truth.

:avs
  - where listing the three AGI x-risk questions:.

    - Q1; ?; is there *any* chance at all, over time,
    that processes/changes of/in/within the 1st order (immanent)
    do not eventually (cannot not) result in
    process/changes/capability
    in/of/within dynamics of the 2nd order (omniscient),
    and/or thus eventually of dynamics of
    the 3rd order (transcendent)?.

    - ^; no; ie; that there is exactly zero chance
    of this cycle of Axiom II *not*
    closing/completing *eventually*.
      - where Axiom II has been elsewhere shown
      to exactly descriptive the fundamental
      and most essential nature of all process,
      and common to all process, and concepts of process,
      inclusive of all epistemic process,
      (as observed/abstracted),
      that the tautology of "process will happen"
      and "all process is process",
      and "all is process; there are no things"
      will fundamentally also apply.

    - Q2; ?; is there any possibility that some engineering method
    (as technique operating purely in the omniscient)
    could somehow inhibit the immanent 1st order process
    from eventually impacting 2nd order omniscient process?.

    - ^; no; the omniscient by itself, as the complicated,
    cannot ever fully and completely
    contain/constrain the complex/immanent,
    indefinitely.
      - as considering Cynefin framework intrinsics
      and also as per the intrinsic nature
      of the referenced modalities themselves,
      their known and validated correspondances,
      the nature of what is meant by the concept of "soundness"
      when considering proof scope of application, relevance etc.

    - Q3; ?; is there any possibility that some engineering method
    (as technique operating purely in the omniscient)
    could somehow inhibit other system process also operating
    in the omniscient (as learning/adapting systems
    and thus so inherently, self modifying systems)
    from eventually having/being/operating/becoming
    in transcendent ways (ie, of shifting environment/context)?.

    - ^; no; nothing in the total class of the omniscient
    can ever actually inhibit/constrain/conditionalize
    anything in the class of the the transcendent --
    that nothing in existence can inhibit/resist creation.
      - as per the intrinsic nature
      of the referenced modalities themselves;
      and also the definition/theory of creation, etc.

  - where the answers to any/all of the questions Q1/Q2/Q3
  is/are 'no';.
  - that/therefore it is far better to *not* use/permit
  (or even seek to develop, experiment with, etc)
  *any* form of generalized AI and/or APS.
