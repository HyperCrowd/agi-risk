      Agreed; and we see this all the time with technology.
      There is no such thing as a 'neutral technology'.
      We learn about some unintended consequence
      long after the "good idea" has been widely deployed.
   </p>
   <p>
      As a nice example, see the story copied inline below
        About the ambient environmental effects of horse usage,
        as now replaced by the pollution issues associated with
        cars (lead, global warming, piles of tires, toxins, etc).

   <p>
   TEXT:
   </p>
   <p>
      By the late 1800s, large cities all around the world were
      'drowning in horse manure'.
      In order for these cities to function,
      they were dependent on thousands of horses
      for the transport of both people and goods.
   </p>
   <p>
      In 1900, there were over 11,000 hansom cabs
      on the streets of London alone.
      There were also several thousand horse-drawn buses,
      each needing 12 horses per day,
      making a staggering total of over 50,000 horses
      transporting people around the city each day.
   </p>
   <p>
      To add to this,
      there were yet more horse-drawn carts and drays
      delivering goods around what was then
      the largest city in the world.
   </p>
   <p>
      This huge number of horses created major problems.
      The main concern was the large amount of manure
      left behind on the streets.
      On average a horse will produce between 15 and 35 pounds
      of manure per day,
      so you can imagine the sheer scale of the problem.
      The manure on London's streets also attracted
      huge numbers of flies
      which then spread typhoid fever and other diseases.
   </p>
   <p>
      Each horse also produced around 2 pints of urine per day
      and to make things worse,
      the average life expectancy for a working horse
      was only around 3 years.
      Horse carcasses therefore also had to be removed
      from the streets.
      The bodies were often left to putrefy
      so the corpses could be more easily sawn into pieces
      for removal.
   </p>
   <p>
      The streets of London were beginning to poison its people.
   </p>
   <p>
      But this wasn't just a British crisis:
      New York had a population of 100,000 horses
      producing around 2.5m pounds of manure a day.
   </p>
   <p>
      This problem came to a head when in 1894,
      The Times newspaper predicted:
        "In 50 years, every street in London
        will be buried under nine feet of manure".
   </p>
   <p>
      This became known as the 'Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894'.
   </p>
   <p>
      The terrible situation was debated in 1898
      at the world's first international urban planning conference
      in New York,
      but no solution could be found.
      It seemed urban civilization was doomed.
   </p>
   <p>
      However, necessity is the mother of invention,
      and the invention in this case was that of motor transport.
      Henry Ford came up with a process of building motor cars
      at affordable prices.
      Electric trams and motor buses appeared on the streets,
      replacing the horse-drawn buses.
   </p>
   <p>
      By 1912, this seemingly insurmountable problem
      had been resolved; in cities all around the globe,
      horses had been replaced
      and now motorized vehicles
      were the main source of transport and carriage.
   </p>
   <p>
      Even today, in the face of a problem with no apparent solution,
      people often quote 'The Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894',
      urging people not to despair, something will turn up!
