      </blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I would be correct, would I not, in believing Martel informed you we’ve passed seven so far? This one will be eight.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Commander Bronson De La Bois speaking with obviously deliberate antagonism as he looks down an aristocratic French nose to the files open on the deep mahogany colored worn wooden desk before him. Files strewn about in a not quite casual manner. Records of the program mentees to date, with the current mentee’s file prominently on top. Desk and files all highlighted in the bright midday sun washing through the floor to ceiling glass windows letting on to a view of the Bay and its islands, over to Sausalito and Tiburon. The warmth of the sun flooding through the windows belying the cold of the wind currently blowing through the Golden Gate, across to the East Bay at this time of day. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             <em>Passed! </em>Bobby Dlamini thinks. He allows himself a brief pause, thinking how much masked rebellion is reflected in the Commander’s manner and voice. <em>These are each and every one a threat we should never have allowed; threats should be hunted down and removed, permanently!</em></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The young lady, just visible in the room at the end of the hall, seated comfortably on the grey blue overstuffed sofa, intently focused on the video lesson playing on the tablet in her lap, appears to be in her early twenties. Though it seems to get harder to tell the actual age of the young the older Bobby gets. Sensing the gaze upon her, she lifts her eyes to peer down the hallway, to get her first look at this new one. A steady gaze, denoting an actively curious mind, intense, without being insane. The sun from the floor to ceiling windows line the entire side of the apartment from the main room to the living area she is seated in, falls brightly upon her, lighting up her pale skin, pale blue eyes and reddish blond beyond shoulder length hair.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Not only are we diverting limited resources away from our primary mission, but these students are immensely dangerous to that mission.” His voice is flat and emotionless in that way only men highly seasoned in death, both on the giving and receiving end, express themselves with. This restraint, making the intent of his words all that much more powerful and unavoidable. It’s the voice of a highly seasoned warrior, a Knight Commander, elder and instructor speaking down to, not his subordinate exactly, but still a junior in The Order. It unmistakably emphasizes for Bobby that Commander De La Bois is one of those who openly disagree with the program.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Harrison had warned: “He’ll seek to recruit or sideline you.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Seven threats are quite enough.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby glances over to observe the body language, the Commander’s features, aged by years and decades of battle, in service to The Order and others before, thinking strongly: <em>Won’t be very many years ahead before I’m old and set in my ways, too. Could be I’ll also be a power in The Order by then. </em></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Commander De La Bois is a man with many marks of age earned in his more than forty years of service. There’s no doubt however, as Bobby knows from his own observations and mission planning, the Commander’s aged, tall slender frame is yet capable of sustained effort and battle if need be.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">His aging face is angular, with a thin-lipped mouth above a strong chin, below deep-set sea blue-colored eyes, all framed by the square jaw and strong cheekbones so many members of The Order possess. Like so many aged warriors, his manner tends to blunt directness, a manner of presentation the uninitiated, the soft and weak, the resentful, misinterpret as arrogance, anger or disdain. An effect made all the stronger by this former French paratrooper, and intelligence community contractor, now senior instructor in the mentee program, keeping to himself even more than the other members of The Order, none of which are known for gregariousness.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Secretly, and careful to keep it to himself, Bobby wishes he knew the full scope of the mission he’d been tasked to participate in. Harrison had been quite clear, however, and that in no uncertain terms: “<em>the Commander’s to be respected, not trusted, not where the fate of this girl is involved</em>.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “We’re not preparing them to live in our future and our world. We’re preparing them to live in their own.” Bobby states, looking down the hallway to the room at the other end, sunlight streaming in, falling across the young lady seated there.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “We believe at least one of our graduates has already been compromised by one or more intelligence service,” the Commander states. “That alone should be enough to shutter this entire program, and to eradicate every trace of it.” <em>Most certainly meaning, killing the seven before and this one</em>.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             It’s important to remain detached, truly detached, Bobby recognizes. In an instant dropping into the flow, allowing for an emotionless inward flow of information, not giving the Commander any psychological surface to grasp onto. It’s a message: “I may be twenty years your junior, but I too am a battle-hardened member of our Order; I’ve passed through the ordeal.” He can feel the Commander’s penetrating gaze upon him, as he looks once more down the hallway to the current mentee who’s turned back to her studies.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The Commander had seen the file, and photos, of this Robert Dlamini, but in person he’s certainly something more than the others had been before him. He’s a natural leader, no doubt of that. Large dark brown eyes, almost pure black, lean but muscular build, and midnight black skin unblemished except for the roped scar above his left eyebrow and the ropey scar down the same side of his neck that disappears into the collar of his open jacket and button-down tan linen shirt. There’s something in the loose posture of this man twenty years his junior, something intended to give the impression of being both totally casual and relaxed while ready to move within a fraction of a second in any direction, under total and absolute control.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">What few had seen, or knew of, if not having read his file, was how much effort and work had gone into just this posture, after an explosion in the Congo had put Bobby in the infirmary and recovery for more than a year. A year in which Bobby had been forced to relearn many things, recovering slowly from severe injuries to brain and body, almost starting all over to rebuild himself into fighting shape.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “You’re a rather reserved one.” The Commander says. “One might believe you’d been warned and prepared.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Is there any reason to believe this one might be another security threat, that she might lack the necessary self-restraint?” Bobby asks.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Approaches and attempts have been made already. Before she was brought <em>in-house</em>.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            It’s an uncomfortable sensation the word “traitor” that comes to mind when thinking of this fellow knight, more so when this knight is a Commander. Was there such a thing as a “traitor” in The Order, given the amorphous nature of it? It’s not as if heresy would be a better word, The Order not being the martial arm of a religion. Neither traitor nor heretic are quite the right words, but they are what leap to mind as Bobby hears and senses the Commander. How could either of these things be true within an organization independent of and older than nation states, non-religious, an organization at its very core both traditional and profoundly neutral, not bound to time, place, nor to any institution nor state?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby shifts his attention once more down the hallway, to the young lady, who takes this moment, using her peripheral vision, to glance sideways at this enigmatic figure looking at her from the other end of the hall. As she listens to the audio of the tailored and personalized fifth-generation warfare scenario playing out on the tablet in her lap.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “She’s a sharp one, this one!” The Commander, not quite hiding the sneer in his voice. There’s an implied violence in just such a sneer, in his corresponding body posture. From this man of more than six decades. Four decades of which had been spent in perpetual conflict and war, overtly and covertly.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby turns back to the Commander. <em>Traitor</em>. <em>Heretic</em>. Revolt does not give it full voice. Resistance and disagreement do not express fully what is sensed in the older man. All of this demonstrates a rupture in The Order. Something well beyond a power struggle. Going against the will of the Lord Commander? Preposterous! The Lord Commander is for all intents and purposes the final arbiter, a king in the old, absolute monarch, sense. Lord Commanders do their studies, take council, seek out opposing views and solutions, only then making their decisions, which all within The Order obey.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “The threats are already multiplying at a rate near beyond our capacities to recognize. There’s no time to be opening up threat vectors from within!” The Commander lets out between clenched lips.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            There can be no mistaking his meaning. Bureaucratic feudalists, petty elites, and their supporting and dependent oligarchs are making their move at every level, everywhere, and all at once, posing a very real threat to The Order and its mission. To say nothing of the threat posed to humanity itself. Seeking to completely enslave the current and all future generations through advances in technology enabled neurolinguistic and banking dominance. Hacking of the human mind and productivity, such it can never, no matter how hard it might seek to, actually break free of the all-encompassing artificial reality tunnel that is bureaucratic feudalist power. The great shared illusion!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Bureaucratic feudalists, so very much like the oligopolist feudalists of old – aristocrats – or so it would on the surface appear, bent on exploiting maximally before disposing of the people. Only differing in their methods and degree to which exploitation is possible. Nothing is quite that simple, however.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “You believe we should be focusing all our efforts on the Malthusians and Trans-humanists?” Bobby ventures to say.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Focus? Don’t joke with me! They must not only be stopped but they must be destroyed. They show no humanity, no understanding nor forgiveness. They seek only to end the game with their eternal war. They lack the ability to understand the game. That’s what they seek to get from us, our knowledge of life.” <em>Those</em> <em>who are not truly alive can never understand, appreciate and foster life</em>.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Possibly true. Though it does seem too simple. There’s more to their intentions than we yet see.” Bobby not disagreeing but not willing to give this wily elder a complete pass. Also, not willing to concede the point, given how little of the war any human or group of humans can actually see.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “We’re making a serious mistake, with this program, thinking we can train the young to wage the war while improving and expanding the game. They lack the experience and self-control to confront the complexity of the threat at this late a stage of the current flaring in the war.” The Commander says, as he looks out across the Bay. The sun dimming slightly, as an ephemeral cloud of white passes between sea and sun. “To say nothing of those who must resource, equip and support them in the battles ahead.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Sixteen-year-olds have birthed dynasties and led empires, won great battles and wars. Made innovations which changed the world. Bobby cannot help but think.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">There’s no doubting it now. Bobby can’t help but recognize this project has caused a split within The Order. The possibility that we might be providing our hardest earned knowledge on how to wage full-spectrum classical and modern warfare, to wealthy and powerful families whose actual commitment to humanity must always be in question. Families with relationships and resources could use such knowledge to bring about great usury and harm not only to their enemies but to their own people. As history, even a perfunctory search of, will provide far more than numerous examples of. It’s a dangerous path for the Lord Commander and The Order to walk.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “We should never provide this knowledge to any house, humanist, matrilineal dynasty, or any other.” the Commander grumbles. “The risks to keepers and heritage are far too great!”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby looks once more down the hallway to the mentee. She’s risen from the sofa and moved to lean against the far wall, lined with old books, tablet in hand, looking back down the hall and straight into Bobby’s eyes. She’s not hiding she knows these two older men, these warriors, are talking about her, are in something of a disagreement. Over what, she cannot know. There’s no doubt of it though in Bobby’s mind, she’s awaiting the outcome of their meeting, this subtle little conflict. Sharp indeed!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “She’s not had enough time with the materials, nor been assessed and vetted sufficiently, to be given the ordeal,” Bobby agreed. There was something of a self-deprecating tone in his statement, something he knew would trigger the Commander in a way was not quite right. The development of a person’s mind along specific paths, unlocking ways of thinking atrophied for centuries, this was The Order’s unique capacity. Use radical truth in the application of manipulation, coercion and pain, but don’t enjoy it, don’t seek to break or own the other, the Commander would now be thinking. The Order knew the truth and power of these things. All the many orders before had hard earned this knowledge, each subsequent order relearning on the other side of long periods of immense human suffering.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Long ago it had all been recognized for what it is. A set of tools that are not to be removed. Organic hierarchies, and the deeply embedded control mechanisms they engender, cannot be removed without destroying the organism. It goes deep in the biological and bioelectrical makeup of all life, laid there piece by piece across billions of years, to ensure the continuation of life itself. Sparingly, and only where utmost necessary, you use these tools, to imprint, to shape and guide, knowing those who succeed at unlocking deeply embedded awareness and survival circuits within themselves, become powerfully bonded. Many have railed against just such ordeals, not seeing the threads that bind in them, not knowing the strength endowed to all bound by these resulting bonds, these chains. Or being threatened by just the same.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I’m not stating we won’t take her through the ordeal,” the Commander says, right on que. Having misinterpreted the statement just as Bobby believed he would. </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “It’s not given to us to see the whole. Only the few are granted such sight. The rest of us do our part, what we’re instructed to do.” Let the Commander do with this statement as he will.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “So, you’re here to prepare and take her through?” The Commander looks down the hall to see the young lady in question, her hands on the bookshelf behind her propping her up, staring openly at the two older men. “If only you knew what she is and what will be asked of her should she succeed in the ordeal.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Is the old former French warfighter, international intelligence contractor become commander going to give it up, lay out what the plan is for this mentee, what the larger intent is for the program?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Her father’s going to adopt her and bring her fully into the family affair. Despite she’s his illegitimate daughter and his legitimate children want none of it and are a very real threat to her.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby looked outside, let the surprise of it pass over him invisibly, before actually processing what it meant. <em>Affair.</em> Not, the family business. Not, the family. <em>Affair!</em> Another bastard child, raised on the outside as a pariah, being prepared by the Nobility, to secure the family from the soft chins and weak minds it had developed after a several centuries long, <em>vacation</em>.          </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">“I’m not talking to hear myself speak.” The Commander states, as Bobby continues to look outside, in silence, giving himself the moments necessary to fully process the meaning of this revelation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Of course, you aren’t! Bobby thinks. You’ve no idea what you give away of your own, patrician, biases.<em> What she is. Affair. </em>It’s not just that we’re teaching, vetting and bringing in outsiders, non-combat veterans at that, but we’re collecting and bringing in the bastards of the great houses. Not exactly picking winners, not exactly picking a side, and yet, certainly taking a stance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><em>            </em>The Commander nods towards the young lady, who’s turned to look out the windowed wall. “Do you believe for a moment these will be able to prevent the collapse?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Now they’re getting to it. “It’s not for me to know such things. I do my part.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Well, you’re careful, aren’t you?” The Commander states plainly, looking Bobby in the eyes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby smiles inwardly. Perhaps he’d learned to be careful over the years. Maybe he was always a little careful, given when, where and how he’d grown up, the streets of Cape Town. But then again, Harrison had cautioned, “Let nothing out, give no surface for him to grab onto. The Commander’s a seasoned interrogator, but he needs time to really grab hold. Don’t give him that time. Everything is accelerating and our opponents need only delay a thing, not fight it, to bring about its failure.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Failure of what exactly? That’s the question pulls lightly at the corners of Bobby’s awareness as he turns back to the Commander. “How could her predecessors have been turned? Has the war evolved that much so quickly as to make our preventative measures that ineffectual? Are we now this known?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “The Earl’s here now. Perhaps he’ll be able to prevent further failure.” From the tone of his voice, Bobby can immediately tell the Commander doesn’t believe his own statement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby knows his role; he’s the only here as guide for the ordeal. For this he’d been prepped to seek more of the pattern upon his arrival, starting with this conversation and the first meeting with Commander De La Bois. He also knows seeing it all in its fullness is not something required of his task.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “The finality of it all!” The Commander states, as he looks down the hallway to the young lady staring back at them. A young lady with not the slightest idea what would be demanded of her.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The damage of the program being compromised was not the issue. Not the reason for the Commander’s disquiet and revulsion. The Order operated decentralized enough that no substantive nor permanent damage could be done. The reputation loss however, having failed to secure against just such a threat as an insider threat. Admitting this, allowing it to stand, was simply not something The Order could permit. The very fact Bobby had been called in early was a tell. A rather strong one invisible to anyone but those few close to this very project and this particular illegitimate young lady preparing to face an ordeal unlike anything imagined.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The Lord Commander knows his people, and their strengths. Bobby had always taken solace in this, making it possible to accept he’d only ever be given parts, not even all the parts he would need for his tasks. Only those few starting points necessary to his finding the delicate beginning of a pattern.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby can see the young lady, still leaning, back to the bookcase, has returned to her studies on the tablet back in hand. This, as the Commander motions towards her.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Imbalance.” The Commander says.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            There can be no doubt this all is about power, power at the heart of the Commander’s <em>treason</em> and <em>heresy</em>. If it wasn’t about balance, the Commander wouldn’t be in command here. The leader of the opposition may not get to determine the objective, but they, as is the nature of structures and hierarchies, get to lead the program to it. The fact the Lord Commander had not appointed another meant the opposition to this program had real power behind it, within The Order at least. This is not the imbalance the Commander is referencing, however.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Commander De La Bois turns and looks squarely at Bobby. Enough words. Enough words for the minds of men highly skilled in the arts of The Order. The Lord Commander had sent Bobby to be the guide for the ordeal. That wasn’t done lightly or because this one was simply the man available.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby can tell the Commander is probing, but it isn’t going to reach Bobby’s inner core, that rock solid center every member of The Order can rely upon in even the most difficult of times and situations. A rocky core found in the ordeal. <em>Okay. Go ahead, sir. Look upon me. </em>Bobby thinks, turning back to face the Commander. The slightest of smiles appears on Bobby’s face, just as a bearded man shows in the room where the young lady is, well-armed and prepared, obvious to anyone well trained in the signs.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “And that is?” Bobby asks.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Carl, the Earl’s XO. Though that’s not what he calls himself. Anyone who isn’t a fool can see he’s the Earl’s right hand.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby examines the man down the hall, in that deeply assessing sort of way only men of certain backgrounds develop. So, it is the Earl, and that’s Carl. He’s from here originally, or so the records stated at the castle. Handpicked by the Earl for this very effort. Short and squat, built like a truck, though with an obvious hitch in his movements from a hip injury earned in combat in Iraq. Getting older. But so too was the Earl. Hell, they all were for that matter. This was no young man’s business.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The Commander notices the subtle fluctuation of energies, as Bobby shifts his attentions from Carl to his charge. Yes, the threat level is that high, even here! This one might be a bastard child, but she’s the daughter of someone, and is being prepared for highest level conflict in defense of her family. If the Earl, the Senior Continuity Commander had been called here, with his handpicked men. Then the threat and danger are very real, imminent and persistent.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “That would imply…she’s…” Bobby starts, having picked up a piece in the movement.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Yes, she’s being prepared for full induction. Raedbora’s orders.” The Commander pauses, to let the weight of it settle in, recognizing Bobby is seeing more of the pattern now. “Her training is to include full-spectrum classical, irregular and fifth generation warfare, so she’s fully prepared upon adoption into her father’s house.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “That’s quite the impossible challenge she’s been given.” Bobby responds. He could remember the difficulties and hardships of his own studies, before his ordeal, and that after a decade on the Teams and half a decade as a high-end merc across Africa.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “The only knowledge she’s to be denied is The Order’s continuity infrastructure.” The Commander clenches his jaw briefly upon stating this. “Most everything else we know, she’s to be given access to, should she ask for it.” From his posture and tone, Bobby can see this deeply angers the Commander.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Surely she can’t command, with no combat experience?” Bobby ponders out loud. The implications!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The Commander merely turns to look out across the Bay, cloud free once more.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            This is something, more of the pattern. There’s something about this one, unlike the previous seven. Something not only worthy of such high security as to bring in the Earl and his most trusted and capable people. But also, to be prepared for command, despite not having the requisite background and experience, being little more than a teen. Surely this bastard child carried the old genes? But which ones.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The Commander, growling: “This’s a dangerous plan…this one…if the design is wrong…by even the smallest margin. Neutrality will be lost, and everything will accelerate uncontrollably.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            <em>This one. This bastard. </em>Does he recognize the deep-rooted disdain he’s demonstrating? The disdain of the legitimate born, those raised inside the walls, against their <em>siblings</em> not so fortunate. The threat of the capable bastard faced by the far too often less than capable legitimate born.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “One must wonder what the position of the gatekeepers, family members and family office staff and advisors is in and around her father’s house.” Bobby articulates. There are millennia of history, of just such sorts being threatened by illegitimates. None of it’s a pleasant history. In truth it’s some of humanity’s darkest histories. Murders upon murders upon far worse fates born by bastard and parent.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Gatekeepers! Bah!” De La Bois growls deeper while grinding the toe of his shoe into the throw rug beneath him. A visceral reaction to gatekeepers and so-called experts. “They believe only they know truth, only they know the mind of their master. They lack history! Damnable Emissaries, all.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby employs a breathing technic to relax his muscles, to back away from the fight. The Commander may not have stated it, but his posture and tone are borderline open declarations of war. No mistaking, however, he’s in command here. There’s an ancient dance to these things. Those with power who disagree most must be those who monitor from close proximity so they may abort the effort rapidly at the first signs of failure. Regardless, that’s a verified descendant to at least one great house in the other room. Obviously, or she wouldn’t be here. The geneticists and genealogists would have confirmed it beyond a doubt.  So, she’s to be afforded by The Order, all courtesies, preparations, and protections.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Harrison had instructed him: “You’re to teach her loyalty in all its forms.” Which now makes sense. One cannot command loyalty if they themselves know not who and what to be loyal to, if they know not what loyalty is.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “She’s very much the outsider,” Bobby puts forward, thinking back through the limited file on Annabelle Morozov. Seeing her posture in the room at the other end of the hallway.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Ignorant and naïve, yes,” the Commander responds. “I take it you’ll engender in her the young’s response to the confidante, to trust. To be followed…” Commander De La Bois shrugs.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby will betray no sentiment. A knight obeyed. <em>I am a mentor. And it is</em>… Harrison’s orders and the mentor’s training required a specific sequence of events be carried out deliberately and carefully.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            To the Commander, Bobby states, “I take it it’s the father whose neuropsychometric profile is very much like that of my own. This would make the most sense. Do we know if this is the case?” This is a pure phishing exercise. The man he’s encoding her for could be any sort of individual out there in the big world.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “No.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby holds his silence. He’d not expected revelation, but it’d been remarked by more than one that psychometrically he bore a resemblance to the older Senior Knight Commander Bertrand Von Mises. Both Bobby and Bertrand were foreign born and raised former Navy SEALs and mercs. The United States does not hold a monopoly on aristocratic warrior genes. Nor does Europe for that matter. The institutional memory of his family in the former British Dominion and those of his years of service, even with mission and unit related skewing and limiting, provided important clues as to the full shape of this mentee program. Despite all the missing pieces the Lord Commander’s instructions had intentionally left out.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Bobby, who’d learned to depend on his knowledge and understanding of the Marshall back at The Order’s beginning. Felt a deep sense of obligation to listen to that knowledge now. Cycles of rise, decay and fall. Over and over again across the centuries, in recognizable patterns. Relating to the current time and task, this knowledge gives off such an incredibly intense sense of foreboding Bobby has to resort automatically to the Vow to Life as he’d been taught when first introduced to The Order:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “<em>I reject the artificial worlds of words to secure that which cannot be defined, life. Words are but a symbolic language devoid of reality. Words are lies that allow only illusion. There is no force more destructive to life than words. Beware most the lie of words that speak of secret knowing. For there is only life.</em>”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Balance returns to Bobby’s inner core.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The slightly glassed look in Bobby’s eyes hints to the Commander he’s struck a chord, but that the younger knight’s training has kicked in. It’s enough however to recognize the capacities of this South African, of Zulu descent, he’s no slouch, no fool, no <em>special</em> assignment. He’s not one of those The Order sends out who is barely capable of the task, of conducting himself without embarrassing The Order. It does nothing to attempt to hide things from someone with this degree of inner development, not even when possessing the same training, work and skill yourself. Well, nothing for it then, he’s stepping into it fully now. Let him know the full extent of what he’s facing in this deadly game, this <em>dangerous</em> program!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I don’t think this one will survive long enough to see herself join that family,” the Commander states leadingly.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby doesn’t bite. “Tell me about her relationships,” he asks. Remaining on mission. The young lady’s safety may the Earl’s primary mission. Bobby’s however is the order and preparations for.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “She doesn’t have relationships; only mentors and teachers.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Are they all the Earl’s people?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “No, there are those remaining from before, some of my people,” not quite a smirk in the Commander’s voice. Not quite. <em>I still have power here</em>.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I will need to meet them.” He keeps his gaze down the hall where Carl is leaning idly against the wall, just inside the doorway, G27 barely visible inside his beltline. The obvious bulges of low vis body armor and concealed radio, weapons and magazines. Bobby realizes with a sudden start, Carl’s watching him, casually intent. Carl’s a message from the Earl! But not for Bobby. A warning the Commander cannot help but see. <em>She’s under our protection</em>!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I should think it’s the Earl you’re most interested to meet,” the Commander states.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “And others.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “You don’t wish to be introduced to her first?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I’ve already made contact with her during this very conversation.” Bobby nods down the hallway where the young lady is once more looking at him. “She’s quite aware, isn’t she.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I’ve only read reports on the others. But she does seem to be something…different.” The Commander begrudgingly responds. “Those damnable old bloodlines and the memory within!”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bobby suppresses an involuntary reaction at the readiness for violent action in the Commander’s words and attitude. There’s not a single hint the Commander holds even the remotest human connection with this young lady, this illegitimate. A sentiment most probably shared by her soon to be family members, if they even know of her pending arrival and role.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            While Bobby is thinking, the clouds from the sea obscure the sun from the Bay once again. A cold wind must certainly be blowing down there across the Marina pouring in through the Golden Gate, across, over and under the bridge. Bobby having looked away; Annabelle lifts the tablet in hand and once again resumes her studies. Preparing herself for what exactly she can’t know. <em>Nervous and excited</em>!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “What does she do when she’s alone?” Bobby asks.       </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Mostly spends time in her room, going through the online library. She’s tried, dangerously, to venture out alone, but we’ve firmly <em>discouraged</em> this.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Can’t imagine she hasn’t come to hate us, then.” Bobby states.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I’m certain of it.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “That’s created a difficulty will have to be addressed first. Hard to be loyal to those one hates.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Certainly, someone of your capacities, a mentor, can have no doubts about his ability to properly adapt hate.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             “A somewhat attractive young lady,” Bobby comments, again not biting.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            As he watches the young lady in the room at the end of the hallway, Bobby begins to have a new appreciation of what the founder of The Order had achieved. Marshall had employed the dispossessed and bastards throughout his entire active adult lifetime – for roughly fifty years, one after the other. The Marshall had been no ordinary force of nature. He’d been an unmovable object in history, not forcing, not directing, but ensuring continuity in things: social systems, natural and unnatural conflicts, forms of government, rituals, religion, families, bloodlines. Were it not for his steadfastness and loyalty and his capacity to engender such in others, no matter their status and station, the modern world would never have come to be. The balancing weight of the Regent’s passage had left nothing in the West untouched, not least of all, knighthood and the lives of duty sustain it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The Marshall had called it “The Way” and mentees like this before Bobby now had figured prominently in The Way, the journey of individuals from obscurity to highest level service, through breaking and redeveloping self, in finding who and what to be loyal to, and how. Bobby had studied The Order’s accounts, the family histories, the only complete record remaining in the world of the Marshall, the Regent, in his own time and place. Even now, centuries on, consciously and unconsciously reaffirming their commitment, members of The Order bow to the four corners of the earth, mouthing each in their own native language, “May we honor the way you set before, guiding those who walk the path after.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Once, it had been the place of priests and their acolytes to push obeisance to God and religion, to Crowns, earthly and unearthly. But this thing, this reaffirmation, had developed its own momentum, becoming a pervasive compulsion in an order of men and women not bound to a church, a religion, nor to any kingdom. Even the most secular of knights said to themselves: “It is right we should say these things.” This mantra was an accomplishment not even the finest religious, political engineers nor military traditions of the world could master or match. The Regent had surpassed the world’s greatest religions, to pass down unbroken a way of total service to humanity’s extraordinary familial heritage. <em>We endure that life may sustain</em>. Even eight hundred years after his death, The Order remained powerless to replicate or change the central core of his extraordinary accomplishment.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Who has charge of her spiritual training?” Bobby asks.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “No one,” the Commander replies. “Why bother? If she fails in the ordeal, her own concepts on such things will be her own and none of it will matter to us.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The young lady at the end of the hall completed her lesson for the morning. Without looking down the hallway at the observers there, she leaves the room via a door to the left, away from the wall of windows. Carl, too, moves with her without giving a single glance down the hallway. Though his passing leaves a physical void in the space that could be felt at the other end of the hallway by those looking.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Those are the Earl’s people,” Commander De La Bois states. “They’re capable, unobtrusive and quiet. Quite disconcerting in their readiness. Do you know about his birth mother? She was on the path to become one of us before she fled Europe in the late sixties. Her own father having prepared her for the ordeal, before his premature demise. Beyond even what the Earl’s own mother did with him in his early years, he’s teaching that girl things better never shared!”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            From his study of the dossier Martel provided for his pre-mission preparation and planning, Bobby knows there had been three attempts on the life of the young lady already. Not to mention several kidnapping attempts over the years. One of those attempts, almost successful, had seen the program move the young lady to the US and the introduction of the Earl and his continuity team. There’s far more than enough threat in the world set against this young lady, quite aside from that Bobby senses in the form of Commander De La Bois and the faction he represents within The Order.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Interesting days ahead!</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The greying haired man crosses the foredeck with deliberate purpose, crossing to where Lord Commander Harrison is standing, taking in a few moments of the warmth of sun and light wind currently in the Eastern Atlantic. The man moves with a youthfulness belies the many injuries and years his body has sustained. To be quite frank, some of those very years and injuries on the other side of the battlefield from the this very Lord Commander.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Alfred Winston Emeril Harrison, Lord Commander of The Order, turns to look off starboard, as the small skiff that delivered this tall, aging and yet athletic Von Mises to the long teak deck of the Aquitaine, turns to return back to its parent vessel waiting off there on the horizon.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Closing his eyes, Harrison runs this man’s curriculum vitae through his mind once more. Not that there’s anything about him that can’t be brought to mind rather quickly, should need arise. Given that Bertrand Von Mises is a well-known entity. It’s still a good practice, for these sorts of meetings, to meditate a moment, clear the mind, to focus one’s full attentions on the conversation ahead. Also, best to cause the other to pause a moment, out of respect for your meditation, puts the rhythm and tenor of the thing in your own hands.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bertrand had participated in twenty-three continuity operations on behalf of The Order, Harrison notes as information flows from memory, behind heavy lidded eyes. These had all been for different houses. This was not uncommon, The Order not seeking to establish recognizable patterns. Nor to take sides or select winners in the ancient game of great house competition. Opening his eyes and watching the man cross the deck, Harrison sees no signs of the scars and wounds Bertrand has earned in service to The Order. They are there, however. Instead, his countenance reflects only hard-earned confidence and that comfort with the world only those few warriors from within the old aristocracy seem to possess. Tall, with an aquiline yet strong bone structure, a pronounced long thin nose above a strong chin. Around the mouth there’s the slightest sign of unwavering resolve.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The Eleanor bloodline, again and again producing sons and daughters of this stature and capacity, Harrison cannot help but note.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Briefly a light breeze brushes across the Aquitaine from the East, ruffling the thin wind jackets of the men on her decks. Harrison is standing in the comfortable seating area just fore of the long salon, as Bertrand crosses fully to join him. Harrison’s all black outfit standing out starkly against the removable white and light blue stripped cushions, the light teak of the deck and the highly polished brass and hardwood table. The central main-mast towering above the seating area set up for this very occasion. Views of the Atlantic stretching in all directions around them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Sitting down, Harrison says: “Thank you for finding the time for this. That you and Dlamini are both available for this effort, makes all of this far more likely to succeed.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I’ve never met Robert. Though I’ve heard he reminds others of me.” Bertrand says, taking a moment to look aft to the captain up on the flybridge, to the man standing beside him, looking out to where the skiff is receding.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Harrison, seeing where Bertrand’s attentions are momentarily, “In its time. Undoubtably, he’s one of our finest mentors. Though that’s to be expected, as you’re both adepts in the deep knowing.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            This always seems an open declaration of arrogance, regardless of who states it, no matter why. Though, the Lord Commander would never make such a statement out of arrogance, knowingly or not. Which Bertrand well knows and understands. It’s to do with the entire concept of <em>Deep Knowing. </em>All of his aristocratic ancestors rose up within him at the very idea. All the centuries of <em>Noblesse Oblige</em>! These very words, this very concept, <em>Deep Knowing, </em>is what had so enslaved humanity to the bureaucrats, their priests and to the many institutions of bureaucratic feudalist states throughout all of human history.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “<em>It’s only the bureaucrats, the priests, the petty intellectuals who know the deeper truths, the science, reality, who is and who is not the enemy.” </em>Such usurious and genocidal prejudice and arrogant blindness in this powerful belief held by all bureaucratic feudalists and their adherents, and the many petty nobles so dependent upon them.<em> “Only we are capable of legitimate thought. Only we are capable and trained in the ways of complex systems, to power, necessary to possessing the Deep Knowing.</em>”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            How many hundreds of millions, billions, had been enslaved and slaughtered by this single phrase, this blatant lie of a concept. Vast legions throughout history, and yet still today. Bertrand had long thought. How much weakness, fear and inadequacy are contained within those who conduct themselves believing in such a deathly illusion. How much fear drives them to so deceive their fellow man.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Of course. Harrison had not used the term in this manner. Quite the opposite. As the son and sworn protector of, he’d used it in the manner of the great houses: ancient life and death knowing he and Robert alike had been raised, educated and trained in. The kind of knowing better preserved along the matrilineal lines and those who serve and secure them. As it’s always the sacrifice of the productivity of their wombs in which the real price is ultimately paid.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Harrison settles back into the seat cushions, eyes out across the foredeck to the foremast and furled rigging, to the gently rolling seas beyond. Allowing the younger Bertrand to sit. There’s nothing quite like the sun on a clear day this time of year to reset oneself, just west of the Azores. Harrison soaks in the rolling deck, sea and sun, his smaller and bulkier frame seated heavily, immovable against the gentle swaying of the Aquitaine. Though getting older, the Lord Commander’s appearance has not changed much in the last ten years, ten years of preparation and one conversation after another confrontational conversation after another, ad nauseum. There’s a marked thinning of his grey-brown hair, and more wrinkles around the mouth and eyes. There’s been no lessening of the calm power and intensity in his grey-green eyes however: this one is in command.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bertrand had seen this pose and look before, too many times. He’s going to point to the seat to his immediate left. Which is exactly what the Lord Commander does.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            As Bertrand sits, Harrison gathers his final thoughts, there’s far too much at stake to get any of this or any other conversation wrong. This one in particular. One misstep in assigning and setting into motion someone to assume their position and role on the board, and all could be undone.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            While an unpredictable leader, these small patterns of behaviour the Lord Commander is displaying are reassuring. Something constant to hold to. Bertrand knows Harrison is not a man of God, not one to believe there’s any great being or organizing force holding humanity together, rewarding the righteous and punishing the wicked. Only The Order and its knights and dames provided any certainty in his world. If a thing needs doing in support of the mission of The Order, then it is done. No valence assigned as to good or bad, right or wrong. It simply gets done. Any purpose not in direct support of the mission, is suspect, if not outright deniable. All outsiders are not to be trusted, while those of The Order, even those staunchly set against the Lord Commander’s vision, are the only trustable resources.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Without looking at Bertrand. “In much of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century and now all of this 21<sup>st</sup>, more people have been killed in armed conflict not declared as wars than in all the centuries before in declared wars. More of the world’s populations now live in direct threat of their lives, from their own governments, from powerful transnational criminal and terrorist organizations, from the hubris of vast non-profits and their overly credentialed staffs and advisors and from financial institutions and governments fostering and driving movements and causes, regime changes. More than ever lived in direct threat during the so-called age of barbarism.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Civility is barbarism,” Bertrand responds. This being part of the deep knowing.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Now Harrison looks at his guest, seated in the spot exactly opposite what was indicated. Rebellion, is it?! “Indeed. Which means what, exactly?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Forced and jealously enforced civility denies the average individual the right and opportunity to defend themselves. Only the State has that permission in civil societies, and the state can and far too often does deny it to any and all it chooses, as it chooses. Emphasizing denial to any with the power to stand to the state.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “That’s certainly it!”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Humanity has become defenseless is what you’re saying, then.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “At its very most basic, yes. It’s not that men have become weak and women insane, actually. It’s that their ability to act upon deep-rooted instincts of self-preservation are denied them, to such degree they’ve given up on reality as the only means by which to function at all.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             “Most would believe much of the blame is on humanity having given up its traditions, walking away from the hard-earned, long developed and proven conservativism and liberalism of their ancestors.” Bertrand looks up at the sound of a sheet slapping against the mainmast in the wind that’s risen up, but which doesn’t bother the two seated men.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Looking back from mainmast to Harrison, Bertrand states. “If they could physically defend themselves, they never would have given these up. These things go far too deep.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Where’s the direction this is leading?” Bertrand asks as he looks back across the foredeck to the sea and horizon beyond. “Does it bear import to the task ahead of us?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “There are those who believe the only means by which humanity will break their bonds, is to reclaim the ability to protect themselves individually, through violence.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bertrand looks intently at Harrison, in obvious manner, as if to ask, “<em>and</em>?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “What do you think follows, should humanity decide to turn the old machine off, or to break free and isolate themselves around their own machines?” By machine the Lord Commander, of course, means the shared regime and its many interdependent supports.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Is that something could even happen? Can the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ancienne réalité artificielle</span></em> be turned off to make way for a return to a base reality greatly updated?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “New balances of power around the world are being attempted, tested and established.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Yes, we all know this.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “There are vast sums of government monies, stolen from their citizens futures, as well as large sums of family office, non-profit and institutional funds developing machines, machine intelligence, moving arms and power in every community of the world, establishing new bonds and relationships. Seeding and sparking the next generations of The Eternal War.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Of course. Proliferation of the old machine, sustainment of the old artificial reality is always sought by these types. These are the expected moves in times of great uncertainty.” Bertrand looking his old mentor in the eyes, those disconcerting ancient eyes colored, faded and tinted like the shell of an ancient sea turtle.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I ask again, what happens when the old machine is turned off, the old system goes offline?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Without the new machine fully up and functional? Without massive and broad-spectrum enough updates in the Infinite Game already in place and growing?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Exactly so.” Harrison replies.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">“Virtually all control mechanisms are removed. Rage and widespread violence ensue, many tens or hundreds of millions die within months. Many more in the years following. New tyrants emerge, as well as self-sufficient communities which are capable of providing for and defending themselves for many years, maybe even decades.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Would breaking the bonds of certain humanity-wide total slavery be worth the cost of those lives and all the destruction associated with?” Harrison prompts his former mentee.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bertrand has no answer, none he wishes to share. And so, he doesn’t. Prompting Harrison to lean back, close his eyes, to take in a deep lung full of the sea breeze. “The sport of kings. We think we can escape it with our technological and social advances. But we can’t.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bertrand had firmly come to this conclusion himself, prior. He says: “Lord Commander, are you having doubts as to our mission?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “No, not substantively. Not doubts. There are very real concerns, however. We think we’re operating independently, free of undue influence. But what do we far too often find?! That much of what we thought were our decisions were actually intentionally influenced by outside forces far beyond our control. To say nothing of the petty decisions we individually make out of our own personal struggles, conflicts and vendettas. And why? Because we’re far too close to and far too defensive of our comforts that others ultimately control. While we should like to believe we can achieve some form of control, a seat at the table. Seems the best we can achieve, is some form of a loose agreement about the world. Agreement which further enables those who in the end do make the decisions.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “This is expedience. Power has always been this way.” Bertrand states, wondering where the Lord Commander is going with all of this.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Harrison motions to the man standing beside the Capitan, the prearranged signal to have the crew bring food and drinks. “If we rely too much on the old forms, the old allegiances and alliances, The Order may very well finally meet its demise.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “You well know I’ve little faith in the old ways and even less we can know what these old ways must and will become.” Bertrand responds.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “We each have weaknesses, vulnerabilities and flaws.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “These also do not concern me.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Yes, yes! Bertrand had always been irreverent and unpredictable. It was a trait shared by many of his Brothers in The Order. Outcasts from all the many organizations and institutions from which they had originated. Damn that independent streak so prevalent among those of the House of Eleanor! Bertrand had spoken it as a barb. One Harrison would not allow to disrupt his peace and connection.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            There’s no rushing the Lord Commander when he’s moving through a thought space, when he’s assessing. Best to take the pauses in his conversation, when and where you can, take the moment to focus on your breathing, to find your own calm center. Not knowing how you might have your mind and being probed at any moment. Bertrand had learned early in his career as a soldier, to quickly drop into the flow, to remain centered regardless the chaos. The Order and the ordeal had further taught him how to completely disconnect, to let go at a moment’s notice, and to float freely in time and space.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Harrison is seeking something in him, <em>probing,</em> Bertrand knows. It isn’t a matter of what Harrison needs to see, but rather what he needs Bertrand to see within himself. It will require letting the barriers down, finding what is meant to be found and letting it go. If it wasn’t in his service record, which Harrison would know, it must be something from the tumultuous years before.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The earliest memories were not of mother and father, as other children seemed to have. Rather there was a man and a woman, to provide the appearance of family, to outsiders. But the first was there only for protection and the second only for caregiving. Their homes and lives were comfortable, everything taken care of, no hardships for anyone. It was a lonely life however, one devoid of deep human connection and warmth. A life of learning and isolation. Interrupted only by the tutors who began arriving very early in his life, to teach him many things far beyond that of other children.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            When he was old enough to question the man, having realized quite early these were not in fact his parents, the only response he received was, “you’ll understand one day, why your father has done this. Till then, tell no one, study hard and prepare yourself.” And when he asked for what, “you’ll know that one day also.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            It wasn’t that the man and woman didn’t care for him as if he were their own. They did. But there was always a separation, a distance that could not be closed, between them. Years later he would come to understand the true meaning of loyalty shown by this <em>mom</em> and <em>dad</em> and why his father, surreptitiously, had put him in their care.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            While he did not know many children his age growing up, not attending schools, moving regularly to different places in the world, his <em>dad</em> moving the <em>family </em>to pursue a new <em>job, </em>it was not a life devoid of joy and happiness. There was a great amount of play in the early years, physical skills-oriented play, thrill seeking and danger skirting play, martial arts, shooting guns, fencing, bow training, diving. Play and experiences only increasing his skills as he aged, moving on to learn to fly fixed and rotary wing aircraft, to drive many different types of cars and motorcycles under different circumstances from roads, to off-road to on the track. There had been the sea, life never being far from the sea, operating motor craft and always sailing. And always the tutors.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The man had been proud of him, of his fearlessness and willingness to learn new things, to take on any challenge. The woman had been proud also, though, through the years, she feared for his safety and often strongly disagreed with the man in private.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Rather fascinating how one’s mind and emotions work. He’d not thought of any of this in quite some years. And yet the memories and sensations were there as if they happened yesterday. Strangely, it comes strongly to him now, even when he was quite young, he’d recognized that while these were good, strong people. There was something tragic about them, having given up their own lives to secure and care for a child not their own, that never would be their own. While they had hidden it well, he could see, in the little things and in unguarded moments, that this hurt them, deeply. That they’d had to force themselves to remain detached and aloof, while still present.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Many years later The Order’s psychometrician had noted in her assessment that there were yet unresolved bonds and attachments with this couple, tangled and confused bonds and attachments that might never be detangled and undone. He knows it, Harrison knows it. Some suffering simply must be born. Used to make one stronger and more capable. This is the true nature of a human, males more so. The true test. It’s the burdens carried, which force through immense pressure, the formation of load bearing and energy dissipating structures within a man. These structures being the man.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            This couldn’t be what the Lord Commander is guiding him to find, to reconnect with, to relive. There has to be more to this visit, here on the sea, abord the Aquitaine. So far removed from land, from other humans and the work. His <em>dad</em> and <em>mom</em> had been there, would always be there in his distant past. It isn’t this he is being set adrift to find.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             There had been quite legitimate reasons for the subterfuge, for the life he had lived, for not having grown up with his biological father and his family, for not having been allowed simply to grow up with his biological mother. That part is well understood and accepted. What had been, was all that could have been. So, this was not the point of today’s dialogue and meet.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             When they came for him, it was in the dark of the very early morning. Two heavily armed and armored men, in a blacked out up-armored vehicle. There was a woman with them, smartly dressed, an attorney, to express a father’s gratitude and to discuss details and provide <em>dad</em> and <em>mom</em> with their payment and instructions for their lives after this assignment. He had known the day would come, but when it did, he wasn’t ready to give up the only life he had ever known, the only people he had ever considered <em>family.</em> It had been twelve years and while it wasn’t a life like that of other kids his age, it had been a good life. A life he had come to think might never end.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             It has to be something in this, that thing Harrison needs him to see. Something in the illegitimate descendant of an Eleanor mother and Garsenda father. A child hidden from a mother who had lost her mind and a father who was married to a dangerous family would brook no threat to his legitimate children. The whole experience had been immense, though powerfully subdued within his psyche, decades ago. He’d not wanted to go, but the man and woman had gone into the kitchen with the attorney and closed the door. The two large men blocking the door, staring at him. Letting him know, in no uncertain terms, there’s nowhere and no way for him to run.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             One of the armed men stood aside as the attorney re-entered through the door to the kitchen, closing the door gently behind her. But not before Bertrand could see his <em>dad</em> and <em>mom</em> sitting at the kitchen island, their heads bowed, looking dejected, exhausted and broken hearted. “As I’m sure you’ve already worked out, we’re here from your father. We need to move quickly. He’s waiting with the plane.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             The last image he had, through the dark windows of the G Wagon, of the last house they had occupied, in the Austrian heartland, high in the mountains, was a lightless, cold and unalive building with the only two humans he had ever really known, sitting in the darkness. In that moment, he knew, there was a far larger world out there, a dangerous world, of power and wealth. A world not of emotions and emotional attachments, but a world required vast amounts of preparation and detachment from others. A world of unknowns. A world would just as well see him a failure, broken and dead than to see him a success, whole and alive.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             The next six years would be much the same. Only with far more people. With more aloofness and outright coldness and hostility from his father’s family. More tutors, elite military schools. Constantly having to prove himself, to outperform everyone around him, so as to garner even the slightest of recognition from his father’s family, wife and three daughters. Though in quiet moments alone, his father would in his own non-verbal way, show his recognition for the hard work and successes of his now fully adopted son. Quite unlike the constant danger in every engagement with the woman who told him directly to never call her mother, from three sisters who saw this younger boy as a direct threat to their suzerainty, their hold over their father’s limited availability attentions. Other than his father, who only did so in private, it was his paternal grandmother was the one to show recognition that he was family. Though even this, aloof and maintaining a distance. So, after Oxford and double firsts in mathematics and economics, he would escape with his father’s blessing to the Royal Marines and on to the Special Air Service.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             It was in the SAS he’d first met Harrison, his two levels above superior, would be approached by The Order, assessed, tested, vetted and knighted, after passing the ordeal. The psychometrists of The Order and his mentor, Harrison, had crafted his ordeal with great care and skill, ensuring the deepest parts of his mind, soul and heart were lain bare for him to confront. Giving him tools, powerful tools, with which to draw upon those early experiences to create structures within himself made him stronger, more inviolable, not incapable of but far less susceptible to the weaknesses of appetites, such as love and human warmth, all binding him at the cellular level up, to the mission and The Order.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             He opens his eyes from the inward journey, to see Harrison, with those piercing eyes, looking straight into him. “It does no good to return to a past no longer exists. We must give energy only to what is. Only the now.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             This was not the first such admonition from Harrison. Nor was Harrison the only member of The Order to express this very same. The psychometrists had spent years working with Bertrand on this very thing. “In times of immense change, it’s not our past which can guide us. Only our present.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Yes, of course. I go back only to ensure I’m not bound by any part of my past,” Bertrand responds.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “The greater past, the past of humanity’s shared history, does show us the way through the conflicts of the change. Can give us examples of what can happen, what might emerge. The fullness of the worst.” Harrison, eyes glazing briefly, dropping into the flow, seeking gossamer threads.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “What is it gives you pause?” Bertrand asks his former mentor.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Connection!” Like a koan, the word rips into Bertrand’s being.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Yes. He, like so very many other humans, struggles with connection to humanity. As a species, as heavily burdened specialists, we’ve lost that ancient connection to one another and the shared human past which had been since the beginning of time.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             “I know my place and mission.” Bertrand responds.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             “Ensure you retain your connections. Remember, it’s not that they must be perfect or even good. They are yours. Don’t forget who and what you are.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             I am what I am. Nothing more and no less. Thinks Bertrand, to himself.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             “What is it actually giving you pause for concern?” Bertrand further prods his old mentor.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             Harrison adjusts himself in the cushions of the seating area, needing to do so having been jostled slightly by a rolling wave that struck the bow at an angle. The food and drinks having arrived, he reaches for the glass of single malt scotch brought to him. They know him too well, his patterns. His modest indulgences.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Now we enter the most delicate time.” Harrison states, looking at his former mentee.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Yes, beginnings are the most delicate of times. But we are well into the beginning. Surely it cannot still be fragile.” Bertrand posits, taking a drink of the San Pellegrino the staff had provided him. Not being a drinker of beer, wine or spirits. Not anymore.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “It’s well underway, but not your part. Your part of the dance begins now. Far too many of our own have doubts about it. <em>Strong</em> <em>doubts</em>. What we’re embarking on may well change everything, lead to something we’ve never yet been.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Is there a start point for further research and contemplation, then?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Not at this time. You’ve all the pieces you require to move.” Harrison responds.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Well, that was that. Surely a change everything movement must be compartmentalized into many different needs to know. And, evidently, he didn’t need to know. He understood, from his years in the SAS and from the many years since in The Order. It’s the way of these entities, these institutions, given their nature. To be compartmentalized, to run teams and groups and efforts in isolation, one from the other. Never any of them to meet or cross. It’s always best to just not know. That way if one is rolled up and interrogated, even tortured in all the incredibly effective modern ways, there’s nothing one can give up but the limited amount they know. This had been the way of the SAS since its inception after the last Great War. It had been the way of The Order since its inception, eight hundred years prior. It had been the way of its predecessors for millennia before that.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “From that which you know of the design. Is there anything that concerns you?” Harrison asks.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Highly seasoned experts in conflict, in irregular warfare and all its many forms, come to develop an instinct for things. Instincts, which become even stronger and more reliable in those who’ve successfully gone through the ordeal, with ancient genetic historical data to draw from at the cellular computation level. Instinct is not something one thinks about. It’s an immediate, whole-of-system, high-coherency utilization signal. The signal coheres into a sensation and an image and you provide it. “The window to act is now. If we hesitate, even for a moment. The window will close and be lost forever.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            It's never good to push an aristocrat into instinct mode. They contain far too much epigenetic memory of ruling, of domination, manipulation and control, of brutality, to trust they won’t call upon these again. More than one mentee had failed the ordeal, having gone into megalomaniac and even God mode, in what was shown them about themselves. But that memory, that deeply embedded institutional knowledge contained within the DNA of every one of their hundred trillion living cells, is a resource that cannot be left unused. But carefully, oh so carefully.  More than one tyrant had been born, tapping into instinct, into epigenetic memories of tyrant ancestors long gone to history. More the risk, as this one is descendent of two ancient lineages with many tyrants, fools and extraordinary warriors, leaders and rulers alike.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            And what of humanity? Did it not also, all eight billion, possess the combined history of all human life? Of all life before, back to the very beginning. Was that not an immense store of experience, of extraordinary genes with extraordinary knowledge contained within them. At the scale of the cell, life had across four and a half billion years, experienced more environments, changes and gone through more adaptations than even the largest computer model and entire centers of supercomputers and even quantum computers could hope to represent. What’s the opportunity not discovered and realized in those genes? What’s the threat?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “When artificial status hierarchies dominate for any length of time. Genetic Despotism ensures only the moderately successful genes exist within populations.” Harrison voices aloud his thinking.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Bertrand hears the message he was brought here to hear. It is not The Order’s place to determine who and what should win. Only to maintain a balance. A balance ensures artificial status hierarchies, those which arise at different times in history, inevitably, do not last long. Not long enough to deny the species the rich full heritage of human biodata. Not long enough, all the truly exceptional, those emerging from known families and those from out among the unbounded masses, are wiped out. In humanity’s greatest need, when real scarcity and crisis emerge, it’s always biocomputation from out there, out in the world, from the most random of individuals and groups of individuals, that viable solutions are to be found. A feat no smart machine is yet capable, not even remotely capable, of matching.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Lacking real connection, they’ll move ever more directly to dramatically reduce human genetic and biocomputational variance.” Bertrand responds. Which is what he was taken down this path to see.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “It’s already begun.” Harrison replies. Both know, Resentfuls destroy what they fear most. The genetic lines of others. The sheer power of Infinite Game evolution and improvement represented in human ingenuity and collaboration among vast orders of strangers, represented in the sheer scale of engagement out among the masses. Innovation and collaboration driven by the power of genetics and biocomputation at play, unrestricted in a species. Not the least, in an apex predator species. This is what they fear most. As it cannot be bounded, transactionalized, valued, priced owned and controlled.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “I begin today?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Soon. Very soon. Prepare yourself.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “You know I came here fully prepared. Or you wouldn’t have sent for me.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            It’s an ancient movement, a <em>pas de deux</em>. The mentor shapes and guides the mentee. The mentee goes on to become the mentor. The student becomes the master only for the master to become once more a student. Everything in Bertrand’s life had prepared him for this, Harrison recognizes. But even so, it’s no small thing to send another human being to their destruction. Even when that destruction is more metaphor than physical. Particularly when there is such a long-established familiarity. Harrison knows he’ll have to be careful not to hesitate nor to restrain, when the time comes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Remember, the sport of queens supersedes the sport of kings.” Harrison says.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Has it not always been so?” Bertrand responds, leaning forward to begin partaking of the eastern Mediterranean lunch had been lain before them on the polished, deeply lacquered wood table. Ah, but our own know us far too well. It’s a comfort. <em>Comforts which both bind and threaten</em>. Connections!</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Preparing for her regular very early morning private session on the matt with Jake, at the Gracie studio on California, Annabelle’s thoughts are on the men who so unobtrusively secure her. There’s Carl, of course, the one she sees most, her close in man. Not really her man. Honestly, he’s the Earl’s man. There’s the Earl, at times, though always omnipresent. And there’s the new man. Something different about this one. Something to be observed and understood. How interesting, <em>something new</em>. She’ll have to put in an exceptional effort this morning to burn up all the excess excitement. Before her daily studies begin in earnest.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">           Riding back across the Presidio, above Baker Beach, north towards the Golden Gate Bridge, the tops of the towers just showing through the trees, Annabelle is confident Carl will report her morning session had gone well. The Earl and his man Carl are a known entity, obviously members of their Order but firmly her champions. What about this new one, this tall dark knight? This one interacts with her in ways quite unlike all the others, all those teachers, tutors, instructors, security and their support staff. There’s something far more direct in his interactions. She can’t shake the sense she’s being prepared for a major change, on the other side of an assessment this new one seems to be here to conduct. Something more than the constant assessments began the moment her father had given her into the care of the program.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">           She’d asked Bronson about this man but had received a less than understandable response. Not merely vague, but actually unintelligible. There’s a power struggle within the organization her keepers belonged to, and Bronson obviously was a leader, if not <em>the</em> leader, of the opposition. She had worked out this much. This man’s arrival meant whatever the plans for her future are, these plans are proceeding regardless of the opposition. Having stated something to this effect to Bronson had induced a visceral response from the old man, an obviously strongly negative response.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">           From the time of her earliest memories, long before being given over to the care of these men and their organization, Annabelle knew there was something different about her. Not special. Just different. Even during the happy early years, before her beloved mother died of cancer at a far too early age. During the years after in boarding schools and summer programs abroad, where she did quite well academically, but not even remotely as well socially. Her mother had taught her to approach the world in particular ways. Ways her almost solely female teachers, instructors and peers could not define but sought to remove from her, generally unpleasantly.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            It's so obvious to even her young self. The world has changed dramatically, even in the couple decades of her life so far. Under the tutelage of these men and their organization, she’s coming to recognize the fullness of it, to see the details of what she’d only loosely roughed out prior. Some pieces of the old world remain, the pre- and post-WWII organization of forces, that of the Westphalian World of nation states, and the locus of power being with these states and their individual and collective institutions. Less and less though, as wealth, immense wealth, virtualizes at an ever-greater rate, real power becoming no longer tethered to geography nor to definable resources and populations. Wealth and power no longer bound by and within institutions, but returning to a far older model, the most ancient and sustained of all models, that of great houses. Once, a mere century ago, known as the inescapable and must be tolerated if not outright hated, aristocracy, which had morphed across the past century into the oligopoly.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Now back at the gated and guarded suite of rooms at the end of Vallejo, on the very top of Russian Hill, overlooking the Bay, from the Golden Gate Bridge right around to the Bay Bridge, across over from the Marin Headlands to the hills above Fremont and the South Bay. As she settles back into her lessons, after a shower and a healthy breakfast. She can’t help but surreptitiously observe the Earl and the new one, Bobby, as they stand bathed in sunlight flooding through the large windows, discussing what she does not know. Nor can she help but observe, more know and feel, the security all around her and this place, the preparation for movement and violence. Even the support staff exude this presence and readiness.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            As seems to be the way of these people, the Earl uses her every question and interaction as a means to impart knowledge and ways of approaching the world. Without stating details, he’d shared with her the basics of urban security. How what she saw and sensed was only the close in inner circle of layered assets and efforts within the building, surrounding neighborhood, the city and surrounding areas. Human and machine intelligence assets, real-world and online observation and intelligence assets, communications platforms, as well as land, sea and air assets, mechanisms and efforts. All engaged or actively standing by in preparation for activation at a moment’s notice. A herculean effort which of necessity extended to the securing of the families of those men and women engaged in the efforts here in the city and the Bay Area.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The sheer scope of it, for one <em>package</em>, is mind boggling. The expense alone, of all those many pieces, absolutely extraordinary. All to secure one individual human. A <em>package</em>, she knows, is her. It’s exhilarating, truly frightening and humbling, all at once. The Earl and his men, the support staff came with them, are all here for one purpose, to ensure she remains secure against absolutely any and all threats. A fact obviously enrages Bronson. Rage the Earl looks off, unphased, as do his people. These are his people, <em>she’s under his protection</em>, and everyone knows it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            All this is coded into the now enhanced lessons and education she’s receiving from these stoic men. Men of The Order, an entity she’d not been able to find anything on in her secure online searches, nor which she’d been able to elicit information on from those she probed with all her not inconsiderable skills. None of it was unknowable though. There are patterns to it, patterns she’d strangely and unknowingly always seen. Though not in the detail she’s now taking in too fast, forced to drink in a raging river, as to say. How does one secure an apartment in a building, in a city, in a country, from attacks which can originate from anywhere at any time. In a country which itself, its organized crime and law enforcement, its secret police, its military and intelligence assets, its privately funded assets and even full-spectrum capable private armies, might well be hostile. To say nothing of foreign actors and insider threats. Of course, it’s all complex, but its knowable, the pieces of the thing fitting ancient patterns.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Biological, chemical and explosive threats, once more at the fore, as well as the newer targeted energy weapons, requiring sensor systems, highly advanced sensors, be embedded in layers, overtly and covertly, into entries and corridors of movement. Highly targeted genetic coded diseases, intended to pass invisibly through populations till they find their target, rapidly becoming the preferred method of assassination. Highly targeted energy weapons designed to destroy human tissues and cellular processes from a distance, in tight narrow energy, light and acoustic beams. Both increasingly the preferred method of threat and control. As evidenced in what records are not destroyed in the shockingly many biological and advanced weapons labs strewn about in the world’s most corrupt and failed states, increasingly being found as the world realigns martial and economic power. As evidenced by the growing number of those with Havana Syndrome and other energy weapon injuries.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            She’d learned shortly upon his arrival, the Earl strongly dislikes static defenses, remaining in any one place too long. Patterns emerge in behaviour when humans become comfortable, confident in their surroundings. Dangerous patterns. The greatest danger being in attachment. There’s no length the human mind won’t go to in order to ignore even obvious threats, when one is comfortable. There’s no denying the Earl’s superior knowledge of such things, nor that of any of his men she’d yet spoken with. Each of them freely sharing with her such knowledge, though not the details of her particular security. This free but careful sharing not the result of any instruction from the Earl, seeming instead to be the nature of these peculiarly driven men and the equally loyal and knowledgeable support staff they brought with them. People she wants to know more about. To this, Carl had been prodded more than once to provide some background on himself, the Earl and his people. But, to no avail. He remains a bearded enigma.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            Except for the temporary, out of absolute last resort necessity, and even then, only if absolutely confident of extraction by larger and more capable and supported assets, does one allow themselves to adopt the siege posture. She knows from her studies the Earl and his man Carl are greatly accelerating. The siege mentality is an ancient artifact has lost any real value in the age of aircraft, precision munitions and satellites, to say nothing of NBC and Energy weapons. Unless one has the power and resources of a capable and well-led nation state. Increasingly, not even these suffice. Something preppers fail to recognize and think through. How well did Waco, Ruby Ridge and all the many parallels around the world go for those who hunkered down to sit or fight it out?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Every war and conflict fought since WWII has demonstrated definitively, advances in technology, even great advances, add very little to defensibility. Wars are no longer limited time events but are forever conflicts. Wars are no longer fought over points on the surface of the earth, nor even over control of physical resources. They’re fought right in the minds of individuals and groups. Even the most advanced and well-equipped military and internal defense agencies of nation states are easily defeated when it’s their own family, believing they are safely home in their beds, pay the price. Just as the gun provides women with equal capacity as men to defend themselves. Real-time and near real-time actionable intelligence enmeshed fully with asymmetric assets are the great leveler.” The Earl had expressed to her, in response to a casual question.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            He’d gone on, seeing recognition of the pattern and truth of it in her eyes. “Bureaucratic feudalists across all of the 20<sup>th</sup>, and now all across this 21<sup>st</sup> Century, have demonstrated how far they will go to retain power. What degree of lies, usury, brutality, murder and genocide they will employ. Billions enslaved, hundreds of millions murdered, and all legally so. As distasteful as it may be, like can only be met with like.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Accountability.” The Earl had stated. “We’ve allowed fully unaccountable bureaucratic feudalist systems to emerge over the course of the past century. Nameless bureaucrats to conduct the abusive slaver work, with zero personal liability of any kind. The oligarchy, seeking ways to shield itself from its own failures, excesses and abuses, its own apathy and disinterest, steadily put in place sprawling and layered bureaucracies as modern shield walls. In older times, the Nobility had no such shield, each lord and lady being fully accountable. To the degree, if they went too far, their own people rose up against them.” Seeing she understood, he’d continued, “The only security in a static position, is the support of the local community and the certainty on the part of your adversary, that you’re prepared to pierce that unaccountability, to make them pay personally for moving against you. That lessons will be administered, which even your destruction cannot prevent. Painful lessons, as bureaucratic feudalists can only learn the lessons of accountability, through direct and personal loss.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            That was all he would share with her, having other duties to attend to. But that phrase had stuck with her, still wrung true in her mind, <em>lessons of accountability</em>. She’d questioned Bronson early the next morning, at their regular breakfast meeting. “Where can I learn about the lessons of accountability?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “What is it you would like to know about them?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “What are they? Are they tactics, techniques and procedures? Is there doctrine and guidelines?”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Each lesson is tailored to the one who receives it and to what aspect of accountability they need learn.” There was something of a firmness in Bronson’s posture and tone, which gave Annabelle pause before asking more. <em>There’s something profound, powerful, and disconcerting in The Order’s lessons.</em></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “When you say lesson, you actually mean punishment?” Even as she asked the question, she knew it wasn’t quite on mark. That wasn’t the posture and tone in Bronson.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “No. Punishment leads only to two outcomes, fear or hatred. Humans make dangerously irrational decisions when they are afraid and when they hate. Hatred possesses the further risks of broader infection and transmission to all future generations. Fear does as well, but hatred is far more contagious.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “Lessons must be measured and tailored to each individual, to their individual culpability. Something must then be taken from them of equal value, in such fashion they know the loss is directly related to specific actions they’ve determined, enabled or conducted. All of which must be applied swiftly, immediately, if possible.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            “My god, but the investment and resources it must entail. That means The Order has to be prepared before its enemies move against it.” The sheer thought of the depth and breadth of efforts must be underway always, everywhere, is staggering.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             “Never operate in an environment where you do not have detailed information of currency on the actual decision makers among the nameless functionaries who run the local bureaucracy. Know the difference between those who define the orders, those who give the orders and those who carry out the orders. Each will require their own lesson.” Bronson continues. He might not believe in The Order’s mentor program, but it’s the way of those of The Order, to teach. “You must never forget that those who seek power care only for power, not for the things you seek and care for. Power must be taken from these. These are your adversaries. Those who carry out the orders, unless also power hungry, are not your adversaries. These are combatants. Each lesson must be tailored and measured to the individual, recognizing this difference.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            She’d asked why, why did they do it, go to such extreme lengths for her. She’d always known she was different, but never special, not deserving of anything like what was all about her now. The only answer she’d received from any of the members of The Order was basically the same, “A balance must be maintained. And you are more than you know.”</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            There was little information to be gleaned from The Order’s private network and its extensive data and information files, at least when it came to The Order, to its knights and members. And nothing related to herself. From the lessons, however, she’d been piecing things together, small piece by small piece. From what she could gather from her searches, studies and from testing thoughts out on the staff, picking up little things mostly from subtle body language changes, she was getting a picture.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            The Order had come into being in the early Middle Ages, chartered not by a church or religion, but by a queen. It was formally established by her champion, a great warrior and kingmaker knight. Drawing upon the model of a far more ancient order. Not religious or crusader in nature, not oriented to the defense of the crown and the realm. The Order was established to address one far more fundamental need, to secure bloodlines across many generations. Not patrilineal bloodlines, which rarely throughout history, survive more than four generations. Matrilineal bloodlines, which historically outlive patrilineal lines, often by a thousand years or more.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            When the truth of it hit her. It woke her bolt upright from a lucid dream. The full pattern of all the gossamer threads finally assembled by that ninety percent of the brain’s activity that is the subconscious. The awareness had sent a shock through her entire being, as if all the nerves in her body had fired at once, in synchronous fashion. As if something hidden deep within each and every one of the hundred trillion cells made up her body had all unlocked a secret room, accessed previously inaccessible segments of her biodata. Now many days later, she can still feel the charge in her body and she’s coming to believe the sensation will always be with her.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            She’s a direct descendant of one of these matrilineal lines. No. Given the level of effort being put into her, more than one matrilineal line. When she had informed Bronson of her awareness the following morning at breakfast, he ‘d stiffened and immediately closed himself off. The Earl had responded differently, nonchalantly, stating only, “You must learn to keep such things to yourself. Guard truth as if your very life depends on it.” <em>Because it does!</em> He didn’t have to say this last part. It was implied in the dangerous look he gave her just before showing a bit of paternal pride in his dark azure eyes, a barely discernable smile around his thin-lipped mouth. Goodness, but this Earl was a man who earned loyalty.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">             It would be almost another month before the fullness of the design struck her. Again, with a bolt of energy rushed through her entire body and being. She wasn’t being prepared to enter The Order. She was being prepared to be served by it. There was a man out there. A man of stature, of a great house. Her future husband and father of her children, who would each be descendants of whatever matrilineal dynasties she was heir to, that he may be heir to. A man she was to bind to herself, stand and walk with. Not to serve. But instead, to rule with. Now so much of her life began to make sense.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            All struggles and conflicts, all wars, are at their very core genetic warfare. Whose genes get to propagate and continue and whose do not. Down beneath it all, driving nearly every aspect of this genetic warfare, is all out ruthless female versus female competition. She’d learned at a very early age, there’s no length to which female competition will not go. It would be a stretch to believe other women are to be feared and hated for this. No, it’s more that there’s something hard refining about female competition.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It's not the steel sharpening steel of males. More, blood sharpening blood. All out female competition hard selecting for genetic fitness through total war. Total female war that knows no morals, no limits, no restraints. Not any of any kind. Nor is there any shortage of soft, weak, or foolish men to manipulate and control, bring into this total war, willing to do horrible and evil things, to bear the blame for absolutely everything. Driven, mostly unconsciously, by the need to do whatever they must to get a chance to pass on their genes. Which eighty percent of every man who ever lived, never earned the chance for. Talk about ruthless!</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">            A balance must be sustained, some things must be preserved. Indeed! Perhaps, The Order and these stoic and immensely dangerous men, are not so unknowable after all. Then again, they are men, not weak men, but instead, monstrous, extraordinarily capable men. Maybe, unless you’re truly one of them, there’s no understanding, only appreciation they exist and are out there. How very exciting! These men may be the Earl’s, but the Earl is hers! <em>Damn</em>, but he does <em>earn one’s loyalties and best efforts</em>. She will double that effort from here on out.</p>
