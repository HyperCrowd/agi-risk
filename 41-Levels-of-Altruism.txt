TEXT:

- [20_20/06/12;12:35:03.02]:.
  - where define 'the levels of altruism':.

    - *level zero*:.
      - as completely unconscious.
        - as no self benefit action attempted.

    - *level half*:.
      - as ineffective for self benefit action.
      - as short term optimization
      and long term disadvantage.
      - example; {fact of / use of} the seven deadly sins.

    - *level one*:.
      - sublevel 1Z; as self action effective (only).
        - as game theory; psychopathy; "playing court".

      - sublevel 1A; as *maybe* able to provide for benefit
      to immediate kin (self copies made),
      or family unit, for reproduction need,
        (ie; elective where death is certain,
        and time to death is hard time bound,
        rather than purely risk bound).

      - sublevel 1B; can actually be able to enter into
      genuine collaboration (play behavior).

    - *level 2 altruism*:.
      - as with respect to the tribal group.
        - where advantage; that a 'pure group of altruists'
        can defeat any other group
        in which there are some defectors
        (people operating to selfish interest).
      - where some groups continually win;
      as creating higher levels of honeypot value,
      which encourages members of the pure group
      to defect (thus become impure).
        - as a potential corruption of
        the purity of the group, in time.
        - as possible whenever there is
        capturable/fungible value.
          - as being able to move things
          from a commons value to a private value.

    - *level 3 altruism*:.
      - as with respect to the state.
         - example; national action;
         the non-tribal group.
      - as requiring the systems of law;
      compulsion of individual behavior,
      manipulation of signaling,
      politics compliance of person, etc.
      - that strong hierarchical controls
      can implement pseudo altruistic behavior
        (on the part of members of the species
        to nationalistic agendas).
      - that the use of these tools
      means that there is a loss of creative responsiveness,
      particularly to chronic problems,
      and moreover, issues of increased honeypot values.
        - as all will strongly strengthen parasitic activity,
        and loss of system creativity.

    - *level 4 altruism*:.
      - as with respect to the species.
      - as not yet achieved very widely
      outside of some religions.
        - example; as not yet attained; outside of
        Bodhisattva Enlightenment.
        - notice; that religion
        is on a pure donation basis.
          - as not actually an economic actor.

    - *level 5 altruism*:.
      - as with respect to the ecosystem
        (all species).
      - that no level examples are yet known.

    - *level 6 altruism*:.
      - as with respect to *all* alternate/other ecosystems,
      and inter-ecosystem relations.
        - as all possible life ecosystems.
      - as the level of altruism at which it is necessary
        (ie; as requiring)
      that a/any/the/all APS/AGI
      (systems/superintelligence)
      *must_be* coherent to.
        - where/if there was other
        tech advanced alien life
        elsewhere in the universe,
        that we *must* hope
        that they are *already*
        at this level of altruism,
        *before* any 1st contact senario.

        - where given the inherent risks;.
        - that any such alien civilization
        would be/become (make themselves) *very* sure
        that we also had comprehensively achieved
        this level of alturism *before* permitting us
        to notice that they exist at all
        (if at all possible).


  - that evolution most commonly favors
  the game theory of individuals
  of each species
  operating to their own benefit,
  and not having any altruistic aspect.
    - as seen by the species statistics.
    - that our own species predisposition
    to group level altruism
    is a built in,
    due to the unique nature of
    "what it means to be human".

    - as that the entropy of probabilities,
    and the dynamics of game theory,
    favors very strong emphasis on individual action,
    than any position in higher levels of altruism,
    on the scale of altruism.

- [20_22/03/18;11:52:09.00]:.
  - where listing/defining
  the 'circles of concern' nomenclature:.

    - that the '*first circle of concern*'
    and/or 'a 1st circle' concern:.
      - as something that affects
      either self, family, or friends,
      or anyone that is in a direct 1st person
      personal relationship to the actor/agent.

    - that '*2nd circle of concern*':.
      - as anyone that is an acquaintance,
      or is someone that knows someone you care about.
        - as basically inclusive of the community.

    - that '*3rd circle of concern*':.
      - as effectively town, city, state,
      however that unit of institution is conceived of,
      and/or the total set of
      anyone you know or interact with,
      or might be expected to eventually interact with,
      in an institutional way.

    - that '*4th circle of concern*':.
      - as effectively all humans.

    - that '*5th circle of concern*':.
      - as effectively all of life.

    - that '*the 6th circle of concern*':.
      - as anything in the physical universe,
      the totality of universal ethics, etc.


  - where considering peoples communicative acts:.
    - that 1st circle concerns dominate,
    at about 98% of all communication actions.
    - that the 2nd and 3rd circles of concern dominate
    the remainder.
    - that almost nothing of 4th and beyond
    even gets mentioning
    in anything beyond philosophical technicalities.
