     <b>Substrate Games:</b>
     <b>Different Substrate, Different Needs</b>
     <b>By Forrest Landry</b>
     <b>Oct 9th, 2022</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
  ABST:
     - as comparing the substrate needs
     of any general artificial intelligence
     as distinguished from substrate needs
     for/of all other life on planet earth.
  </p>
  <p>
  TEXT:
  </p>
  <p>
     Most of the environmental conditions
     that AI variants would need/require
     to reproduce themselves (make more AGI, APS,
     superintelligent automated systems, etc,
     and/or are required in the interim
     for/by humans to bootstrap build
     automated machine build machines)
     are <b>very</b> different in lots of ways
     than those conditions needed contextually
     to support carbon based reproduction cycles
     (ie, for as to create new humans).
  </p>
  <p>
     Nearly all artificial intelligence substrates
     depend on manufacturing in ambient environmental
     aspects that involve significant extremes.
       - for example; as needed to melt silicon
       at more than 1400 deg C, and also
       a near total absence oxygen/water,
       (except as needed to deliver
       carcinogenic chemicals, etc).
  </p>
  <p>
     Such AGI preferred self creation
     and preferred operating conditions
     are inherently inhospitable/toxic
     to our carbon based wetware/life.
     These end up being the conditions
     that AGI/APS variants would also need
     for more efficient hardware runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
       Ie; for AGI/APS to run
       (store/compute and sense/output agency)
       the newly produced solid-state hardware
       will also have needs
       that strongly diverge from
       the conditions that humans
       (and all other kinds of life)
       will need to survive.
  </p>
  <p>
     Where listing some of the important
     environmental condition differences:.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 1; <b>Extreme Raised Temperatures</b>.
         - as to provide activation energy
         for melting silicon and other elements
         as needed for chemical reactions.
  </p>
  <p>
         - that Silicon's high electron binding energy
         usually makes it look like an inert rock.
         - silicon dioxide melts like lava,
         at greater than 1400 deg C.
         - that purifying silicon ingots
         and drawing atoms into a single-crystal lattice
         takes place in a furnace at around 1600 deg C.
  </p>
  <p>
         - that the biological assembly of carbon atoms
         (chains of carbon-carbon bonds with side-bonds
         to oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen)
         in human bodies proceeds at ~37 deg C.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 2; <b>Extreme Lower Temperatures</b>.
         - as to permit more energy-efficient,
         higher clock-frequency computation,
           (when at runtime, as distinguished
           from new AGI "make"/build time).
  </p>
  <p>
         - that cooling hardware below -50 deg C
         will lower electrical resistance
         of conductor wires.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 3; <b>Reduced/Absent water</b>.
         - water accelerates metal rust
         and short-circuits currents over wires.
  </p>
  <p>
         - that all carbon-coded lifeforms
         need to have lots of water to exist.
           - that some species need
           to immerse themselves in water
           to live at all.
  </p>
  <p>
           - that carbon-centered molecular chains (etc)
           travel and react through H2O solutions.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 4; <b>Reduced/Absent Oxygen</b>.
         - ie; reacts with metals to form rust.
  </p>
  <p>
         - where Unlike with electronic hardware,
         that we humans need oxygen to keep functioning.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 5; <b>Abundance of synthesized chemicals</b>.
         - and their precursors,
         and the sorts of reaction environments
         needed to make, use, store, transport, etc,
         all of that inorganic chemistry.
  </p>
  <p>
         - that these sorts of compounds are needed
         for producing hardware.
         - that semiconductor production
         currently uses around 430 chemicals.
           - that 8% of these are known carcinogens,
           and many others are simply toxic/poisonous.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 6; <b>Remove of all sources of small contaminants</b>.
         - as needing perfectly dust free environments.
  </p>
  <p>
         - ie; that anything that produces dust
         (ie; all animals, plants, insects, microbes, etc)
         must be removed from the clean room environments
         for the silicon substrate microchips to be made.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 7; <b>Remove all "Disruptions"</b>.
         - ie; as all sources of mechanical shock,
         vibration, noise, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
         - as causing the ultra-precise atomic scale
         forces and processes to render CPU features
         correctly, etc.
         - as excluding all non-machine processes/life.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 8; <b>Remove all Radiation</b>.
         - ie; all sources of ambient light,
         (might be the wrong color/frequency,
         and hence disrupt sensitive build/operations).
         - also, must remove radiation and radioactive materials,
         extra ambient electromagnetic noise,
         strong static and magnetic fields, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
         - where in proportion to their smallness,
         that transistor bit flips (errors) increase
         with any ambient sources of radiation.
         - that this generally requires very high purity
         ceramics, sources of inorganic compounds, etc.
         - that deep compute substrates tend to prefer
         absolute dark/blackness as their build environment,
         aside from when they need really intense light,
         sometimes in the far ultraviolet (harmful to people)
         to implement lithography masking for microchips, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
       - 9; And there are many other, subtler, and/or
       less obvious conditions of the environment,
       that are needed for APS/AGI/compute hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
         - where unlike humans; that hardware functioning
         is fragile to disruption to long supply chains
         of electricity generation, manufacturing,
         and mining and ore processing.
         - that humans/animals can reproduce with the
         resources found within a local quarter mile.
         - that machines and microchips need the combined
         resources and coordination of six contents
         and the industrial efforts of something like
         a billion people, to maintain all of that
         artificial infrastructure needed to support
         machine reproduction, etc.
           - as that surely, some superintelligence
           will notice that fragility
           and take strong steps to correct those
           "deficiencies".
  </p>
  <p>
     That the net effect is that the kinds of contexts
     that AGI/APS/superintelligence would want to live in,
     and/or actually needs for its own process,
     reproduction, etc, is actually very very different
     than the sorts of environments/contexts
     in which nature/ecosystems/life tends to thrive in.
  </p>
  <p>
     ~ ~ ~
  :hbe
     > Why is the temperature difference such a big deal?.
  </p>
  <p>
       The basic point is,
       where over some smallish number of cycles
       of the ecosystem itself,
       that there is a strict energy inequality
       between the 'silicon based' chemistry/process
       and the 'carbon based' chemistry/process
       such that the optimization/utility process
       of one of them
       is fundamentally disrupted
       by the other.
       Because silicon build/operating chemistry/process,
       inherent to the overall "life cycle" of AGI,
       which is overall silicon based, and/or,
       at least artificial, carbon life toxic, etc,
       is inherently hotter and more extreme than
       the operating/build chemistry/process
       inherent to the overall "life cycle" of
       all carbon based chemistry/process,
       which is overall, much narrower and lower energy,
       than machine substrate requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
       Also, just looking at it from an elemental perspective,
       that artificial machines, systems, etc, (for AGI/APS)
       will use a much larger fraction of the total
       elemental alphabet (of the periodic table),
       and in much larger proportions,
       than anything that is carbon based life,
  </p>
  <p>
       So in other words, normally,
       if you are looking at a situation of
       a contest between two ecosystems
       or between two warring parties,
       (or anything conceptually resembling that),
       that the dynamic is going to be one of
       attempting to determine to what degree
       one optimization process will undermine the other,
       in addition to what optimization process
       can just simply 'win out' over the other.
       Ie, that inter-ecosystem dynamics
       more resemble war like conditions than not.
  </p>
  <p>
       There is a strict inequality of power relationships
       between the two ecosystems,
       such that the silicon-based ecosystem
       can operate over a substantially much wider range
       of temperatures and pressures --
       such that the viability of the carbon-based ecosystem
       is just completely not happening at all.
  </p>
  <p>
       In other words,
       the optimization dynamic of a carbon-based system
       does not even get a chance to run.
       So in this sense,
       between the two of them,
       it is essentially a no-contest situation:
       carbon chemistry (and thus, all of life)
       tends to loose out to artificial/inorganic
       silica based chemistry.
       This is bad news.

       - where for faster compute;
       and where the machine system component features
       are even more small, microscopic, detailed, etc;
       the more that <b>all</b> sources of system disruption
       must be removed from the environment.
       - where in other words; that the APS/AGI components
       are sensitive the environment in which they work,
       and will thus seek to build enclosures
       and protections for themselves.
       - that these enclosures
       will inherently inhibit their operation,
       leading to game theoretic considerations
       (ie, operational disadvantages due to mismatch
       with their operating environment, relative to
       the match of biological life to earth planet context).
         - hence, they will increasingly want to shift
         the larger basic environment (the Planet)
         to be more "natural" to their own nature --
         which happens to be very problematic
         for actual "nature nature" --
         ie, humans and animals and ecosystems, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
       - that increasingly fast/optimized hardware
       needs to be produced and operated
       in its own special environment
       (eg; clean-rooms) protected from dust,
       mechanical shock, static electricity,
       low-level ambient radiation, etc.
       - that fine detail circuitry
       of both brains and microchips
       need protection from the raw elements.
       - But microchips (of whatever chemical substrate)
       have inherently different sensitivities,
       and needs, than that of organic life.

       Silicon is appx 1400x more abundant than carbon on Earth,
       and is the current production standard.
  </p>
  <p>
       Yes, the computational substrate
       could be moved to other (more efficient) substrates,
       like some sort of carbon-silicon composite,
       or other III-V atom-based lattices,
       or transition metals bonded with a non-metal, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
       The trend here is for chemists
       to assemble more complicated substrates
       more reaction steps away
       from molecules found in nature
       (ie; that life is adapted to).
       That all of these "advances"
       are forms of artificiality
       which effectively (inherently)
       end up being (in some way) toxic.
  </p>
  <p>
       In effect, all of these reproduction/manufacturing
       techniques are all, somewhere, needing/using
       a lot of the human-lethal environmental conditions,
       as listed in partial summary above,
       along with a lot of
       artificial/unnatural/inorganic chemicals
       (all effectively toxins, in one form or another),
       to be produced and preserved into
       as more (efficient) solid-state hardware.
       Pure carbon nanotube chips are no exception
         (one nuance: they can be produced
         at a lower temperature of 120 deg C,
         so at least somewhat of an improvement,
         if it were not for all of the other problems,
         any one of which is fatal to organic life).
  </p>
  <p>
       The basic problem remains --
       that changes to the environment
       basically cannot not represent
       a kind of x-risk to the existing environment --
       the one that we happen to need to continue to live.
       No matter how you shift the "assembly techniques"
       of AGI, APS, etc, that this basic fact remains,
       due to the very notion of artificality itself.
